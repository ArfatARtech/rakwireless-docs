# How to Use the Pin Mapper

---

<br>

1. Download and save the Pin Mapper in **`.xlsx`** format, and then open it in **Microsoft Excel**.

:::tip üìù NOTE

2. Select the WisBlock module/s from the dropdown list. The WisBase and WisCore are required fields.

3. Choose **NA** for those slots that are not applicable or for those slots that you will not use.

/>


The mapper will only reflect pin compatibility data of slots available with the chosen WisBase.

:::tip üìù NOTE

Pinouts highlighted in yellow might cause conflicts.

:::

- **Example 1**: Board options were selected for both WisIO slots 1 and 2, but the tool didn‚Äôt show pin mapping compatibility info because RAK5005-O has one WisIO slot only.

- **Example 2**: Options were selected for both WisIO slots 1 and 2, and the tool showed pin mapping compatibility info for both WisIO Board 1 and 2 because RAK19001/19011 has two WisIO slots.
