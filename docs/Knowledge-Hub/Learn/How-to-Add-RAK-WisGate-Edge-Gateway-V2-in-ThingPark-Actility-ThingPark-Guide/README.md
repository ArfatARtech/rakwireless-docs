# How to Add RAK WisGate Edge Gateway V2 in ThingPark - Actility ThingPark Guide


ThingPark is an Actility platform, where you can register your LoRaWAN gateway and end devices. ThingPark offers a user-friendly dashboard, in which you can monitor different information about the gateway/end device like status, radio traffic, statistics, and more.

In this guide, you will learn how to connect a RAK Edge gateway V2 to the ThingPark platform via Basics Station.

## Register the Gateway in ThingPark
