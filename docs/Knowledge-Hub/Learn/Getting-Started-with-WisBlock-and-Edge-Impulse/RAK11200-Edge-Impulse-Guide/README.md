:::tip üìù NOTE
You can also build the firmware using the [**RAK11200 Edge Impulse source code**](https://github.com/mcmchris/wisblock-edge-impulse).
:::

### Connecting to Edge Impulse

Connect your WisBlock board to your PC through the USB cable. In the command prompt or terminal, run the following code:

```
edge-impulse-daemon
```
This will start a wizard which will ask you to log in and choose an Edge Impulse project. If you want to switch projects, run the command:

```
--clean
```

### Verifying Connection 

After running the command, your WisBlock is now connected to Edge Impulse. To verify this, go to your [**Edge Impulse Project**](https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/studio/select-project?autoredirect=1), and click **Devices**. The device should be listed here.

## RAK11200 Trained Model Deployment

RAK11200 ESP32 core lets you deploy your model using the native **ESP IDF** or **PlatformIO**. You can select your preferred option.

### Deploying Your Model Back to WisBlock

#### ESD IDF

After training and validating your model, you can now deploy it to your WisBlock board. This makes the model run without an internet connection, minimizes latency, and runs with minimal power consumption.

On your Edge Impulse project, navigate to the **Deployment** tab on the left menu and select the **C++ library** option.


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/knowledge-hub/wisblock/Getting-Started-with-WisBlock-and-Edge-Impulse/rak11200/esp-idf/library.png"
  width="80%"
  caption="C++ library"
/>

Edge Impulse offers an optimization tool that can help you increase on-device performance but may reduce accuracy. You can test each option one by one and stay with the best results. You can also click the **Analyze optimizations** button before deploying it and see the recommended choice for your target. Or, click **Build** to use the currently selected option.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/knowledge-hub/wisblock/Getting-Started-with-WisBlock-and-Edge-Impulse/rak11200/esp-idf/build-library.png"
  width="80%"
  caption="Building the library"
/>

Download the `.zip` library and save it to your preferred location, then unzip it.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/knowledge-hub/wisblock/Getting-Started-with-WisBlock-and-Edge-Impulse/rak11200/esp-idf/unzip.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Unzipping the library"
/>

Now, you need to build the firmware for your corresponding core with the trained model added to it.

Download and install [**ESP IDF v4.4**](https://dl.espressif.com/dl/esp-idf/).

- Download or clone the firmware from the [Github repository](https://github.com/mcmchris/wisblock-edge-impulse).
- You'll need two additional components to compile the firmware:
    - LIS3DHTR_ESP-IDF
    - ESP-NN
- Then open the **ESP-IDF 4.4 CMD** from the Desktop shortcut.
- Navigate to the firmware folder `../RAK11200-Edge-Impulse-Firmware`.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/knowledge-hub/wisblock/Getting-Started-with-WisBlock-and-Edge-Impulse/rak11200/esp-idf/firmware-folder.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Navigating to the firmware folder"
/>

Get the additional components by cloning the corresponding repositories to the **components** folder in the root folder of the project: `../RAK11200-Edge-Impulse-Firmware/components`.

```
cd components
git clone <https://github.com/AIWintermuteAI/LIS3DHTR_ESP-IDF.git> LIS3DHTR_ESP-IDF/
cd LIS3DHTR_ESP-IDF 
git checkout 641bda8c3e4b706a2365fe87dd4d925f96ea3f8c 
cd ..
git clone <https://github.com/espressif/esp-nn.git> esp-nn/
cd esp-nn 
git checkout 24d18025f300c1e15afa2abb86519da54c7a5d90 
cd ..
cd ..
```

With the last `cd ..`, you must be in the project folder `../RAK11200-Edge-Impulse-Firmware`.


<b> Add Your Trained Model Library </b>

Replace the edge-impulse-sdk, model-parameters, and tflite-model folders from the project with the new ones in the trained model library.

  width="80%"
  caption="Copy and paste the trained model folders"
/>


<b> Build the Application </b>

- Delete the build folder from the project. (Important)
- Run the following command:

```
idf.py build
```

<b> Flash </b>

- Connect the RAK11200 ESP32 WisBlock board to your computer.
- Short BOOT0 and GND then press the Reset button of the base board. (To restart the core in boot mode)
- Identify the COM port where it's connected.
- Run the following command:

```
idf.py -p COMxx flash monitor
```

Where `COMxx` needs to be changed to the actual port where your WisBlock is connected on your system.

- After uploading successfully, reset the board.


:::tip üìù NOTE
Also, you can build and flash the firmware using the **Visual Studio Code Esspressif** plugin.
:::


<b> Run the Model </b>

From a command prompt or terminal, run:

```
edge-impulse-run-impulse
```

If your model uses audio, you may use the `--continuous` command as follows:

```
edge-impulse-run-impulse --continuous
```

Your model should run and print the inference results in the terminal continuously.

#### PlatformIO 


After training and validating your model, you can now deploy it to your WisBlock board. This makes the model run without an internet connection, minimizes latency, and runs with minimal power consumption.


:::tip üìù NOTE
In installing and setting up the PlatformIO to work with WisBlock ecosystem boards, refer to the [Learn section](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/Board-Support-Package-Installation-in-PlatformIO/).
:::

On your Edge Impulse project, navigate to the **Deployment** tab on the left menu and select the **Arduino library** option.
