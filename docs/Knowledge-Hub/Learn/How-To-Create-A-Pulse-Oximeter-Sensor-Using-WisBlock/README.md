# How to Create a Pulse Oximeter Sensor Using WisBlock

In this time of the pandemic, especially with our response in treating and monitoring the infections caused by the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), it is important to have the right assessment of your health.

A Pulse Oximeter Sensor is one of the most used tools in health monitoring. In this guide, you will create a Pulse Oximeter Sensor with WisBlock, which can help you to have easy access to health monitoring tools. You may also create a health kiosk with this Pulse Oximeter Sensor with the WisBlock platform.

According to Ridgmount Practicesâ€™ Website, an ideal oxygen level is between 96% and 99%, and an ideal heart rate is between 50 and 90 beats per minute (bpm).

The table below shows the ranges and classification of Blood Oxygen Level and Heart Rate.


| Observation                | Blood Oxygen Level | Heart Rate (BPM) |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| Normal Reading             | 96% or more        | 40-100           |
| Acceptable                 | 95%                | 101-109          |
| Seek Advice                | 93%-94%            | 110-130          |
| Need Urgent Medical Advice | 92% or less        | 131 or more      |

5. Download the code of the [RAK12012 MAX30105 LCD I2C](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VB6nxWG9FcTTPRD_kC5N0_pySgqrSm15?usp=sharing)), and then open it using Arduino IDE.

6. After that, install the [RAKwireless WisBlock Core](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index) modules for the Arduino Board manager. Follow the instructions provided in the mentioned tutorial for proper installation.

7. After installing, you should click the URL, as seen in **Figure 6**, to install the library for Pulse Oximeter Sensor.
