If you choose the All working mode, you can change the Normal light color, that is the light you see when the gateway is working properly. The blinking frequency can be changed as well ‚Äì you can choose from Slow, Fast, and Steady. It‚Äôs possible to configure the color of the Warning light in All working mode as well. Note that the colors for the Normal and the Warning Light cannot be the same.
