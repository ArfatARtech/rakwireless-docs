# Global Integration

This tutorial covers a detailed look at one of the connectivity options of WisGateOS ‚Äì Global integration. More specifically, two use cases is considered:

## Connecting a WisGate Edge Gateway with AWS IoT Core

A separate detailed guide for the [AWS IoT Core Integration](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/AWS-IoT-Core-Integration/) can be found in the Knowledge Hub. 

## Connecting a WisGate Edge Gateway with External MQTT Broker

### Introduction

MQTT or Message Queuing Telemetry Transport protocol is a machine-to-machine connectivity protocol used in the IoT world. MQTT relies on the TCP (Transmit Control Protocol), which on its own do not allow encrypted communication between the server and the client. To make MQTT more secure, many MQTT brokers (servers) use TLS (Transport Layer Security) instead of plain TCP, which will be tackled in this tutorial.TLS has different modes of working, which represents different levels of encryption. For this guide, the **Self-signed server certificate** mode is used.

### Requirements
This is what you will need to prepare before they can make the connection itself: 
  - **WisGate Edge series gateway running latest WisGateOS version**: It will work on all of the products of this series without any difference.
  - **A host to run the MQTT broker on**: The possibility of options here is limitless, but for this tutorial, the Raspberry Pi 4 running Raspberry Pi OS Lite is used.

### Making the Connection

1. Installing the MQTT Broker to the host.

For the tutorial, the Mosquitto broker will be used, but another broker can be selected depending on the project‚Äôs needs. This is the set of commands to install the Mosquitto broker on the Raspberry Pi 4:

```
wget http://repo.mosquitto.org/debian/mosquitto-repo.gpg.key
```

```
sudo apt-key add mosquitto-repo.gpg.key
```

```
wget http://repo.mosquitto.org/debian/mosquitto-buster.list
```

```
sudo apt-get update -y
```

```
sudo apt-get install mosquitto
```

2. Generating the authentication files.

For self-signed server certificate mode TLS, you will need a **Server Certificate**, **Server Key**, and a **CA Certificate**. To create them, [OwnTracks Tool](https://github.com/owntracks/tools) is used, which has a script that automatically creates the required keys, and this tool is using OpenSSL. First, you need to clone the repository, and make sure to have **git** installed:

```
sudo apt-get install git
```

  src="/assets/images/software-apis-and-library/wisgateos/subdocument8/36.2.installing-git.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Installing git"
/>


3. Now, you have to clone the tool and run the **generate-CA.sh** script. After the execution, the newly created files will be in the same directory as the script itself:

```
sudo git clone https://github.com/owntracks/tools.git
```

```
cd tools/TLS
```

```
sudo ./generate-CA.sh
```

  width="100%"
  caption="Generating the Certificates"
/>


4. Set up the Mosquitto Broker

In setting up the Mosquitto Broker, give it an access to the three needed files: **ca.crt**, **raspberrypi.crt**, and **raspberrypi.key**. The last two (2) files can have different names depending on what device is used for the host. Copy **ca.crt** to location **/etc/mosquitto/ca_certificates** and the other two files under location **/etc/mosquitto/certs** with the commands:

```
sudo cp ca.crt /etc/mosquitto/ca_certificates/
```

```
sudo cp raspberrypi.crt /etc/mosquitto/certs/
```

```
sudo cp raspberrypi.key /etc/mosquitto/certs/
```

5. To finish the broker setup, you need to configure it. Navigate to **/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf** with the command:


```
sudo nano  /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf  
```

The changes that need to be made in the file are listed in the table: 

| Content of the line                             | Description                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| listener 8883                                   | This will add a listener on port 8883, which is the default port for TLS communication. This line should be at the very beginning of the file. |
| cafile  `/etc/mosquitto/ca_certificates/ca.crt` | This line will specify where the `ca.crt` file is. It should be at the end of the file.                                                        |
| keyfile `/etc/mosquitto/certs/raspberrypi.key`  | This line will specify where the `raspberrypi.key` file is. It should be at the end of the file.                                               |
| certfile `/etc/mosquitto/certs/raspberrypi.crt` | This line will specify where the `raspberrypi.crt` file is. It should be at the end of the file.                                               |

6. Restart the Mosquitto service to load the configuration file.

```
sudo systemctl restart  mosquitto.service
```

7. Global integration setup.

You need to provide the `ca.crt` file to the gateway that you want to connect to this broker. The first step is to copy the content of the `ca.crt` file to the clipboard. Do that by using the `cat` command. Issue the following command to display the certificate‚Äôs content and then copy it like this: 

```
cat ca.crt
```

  width="100%"
  caption="Mosquitto Configuration"
/>


Make sure to copy only the certificate as even one extra symbol could make the certificate invalid.


8. In the gateway‚Äôs Web UI, navigate to **LoRa Network** > **Global Integration** and do the following setup:

- **MQTT Broker Address** ‚Äì Enter the MQTT broker host‚Äôs address.

- **MQTT Broker Port** ‚Äì The value should be 8883.

- **SSL/TLS Mode** ‚Äì From the drop-down menu, select **Self-signed server certificate**.

- **TLS Version** ‚Äì From the drop-down menu, select **TLSv1.2**.

- **CA Certificate** ‚Äì Paste the copied CA Certificate. Make sure that there are no spaces before and after the certificate.

9. Click **Save & Apply** and the configuration will be ready.


10. Test on the connection by subscribing to one of the gateway‚Äôs topics via **Mosquitto clients**. To install **mosquitto-clients**, use the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install mosquitto-client
```

  caption="Install Mosquitto Clients"
/>


 Now, use **mosquitto_sub** to subscribe to a topic and see if uplinks are received:

```
mosquitto_sub -h <host‚Äôs IP> -p  8883 -t application/1/device/+/rx ‚Äìcafile  /etc/mosquitto/ca-certificates/ca.crt 
```
