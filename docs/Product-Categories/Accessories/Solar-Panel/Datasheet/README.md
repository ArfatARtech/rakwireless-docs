# Solar Panel 80 x 45 mm Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

This solar panel is the perfect add-on to your IoT product. With its size of 80 x 45&nbsp;mm, it fits on the Unify Enclosures or your custom enclosures. It charges the battery from the sun and extends the battery life. If you have a low-power solution built with our WisBlock system or based on our low-power WisDuo modules, it can keep your device independent from recharging through external supplies.

It comes with a 10&nbsp;cm long cable and ZHR-2 1.5&nbsp;mm plug that fits with the connectors of our WisBlock Base Boards and the RAK5010 WisTrio modules.

### Features

- Size 80 x 45 x 2&nbsp;mm
