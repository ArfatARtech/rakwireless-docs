# 902-928MHz 5dBi Fiberglass Antenna Datasheet


## Overview

The 5&nbsp;dBi Fiberglass antenna is an outdoor, high-performance antenna, designed to withstand harsh outdoor conditions. It is specially designed for LoRa¬Æ in the 902-928&nbsp;MHz band ‚Äì US915, AU915, AS923, and KR920.
The antenna connector is one with the antenna body - this design further increases the resistance of the antenna to external conditions.
With a length of only 480&nbsp;mm, this antenna will be the best fit for your LPWAN Gateway or outdoor deployed RAK Hotspot Miner.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
This antenna is designed to be directly mounted on the enclosure of the Gateway. It is suitable for [RAK7240](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisGate/RAK7240/Overview/) and [RAK7249](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisGate/RAK7249/Overview/). The antenna is also compatible with [Outdoor Enclosure for RAK Hotspot Miner](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/Accessories/Outdoor-Enclosure-Kit/Overview/#rak-hotspot-miner-outdoor-case), [Bobcat Outdoor Enclosure Kit](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/Accessories/Bobcat-Enclosure-Kit/Overview/), and [Antenna Magnetic Base](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/Accessories/RAKA0C52/Overview/).
