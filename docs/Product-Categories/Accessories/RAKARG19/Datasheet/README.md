# 902-928 MHz 5.1 dBi Fiberglass Antenna Datasheet

## Overview

The 5.1&nbsp;dBi Fiberglass antenna is an outdoor, high-performance antenna, designed to withstand harsh outdoor conditions. It is specially designed for LoRa¬Æ in the 902-928&nbsp;MHz band ‚Äì US915, AU915, AS923, and KR920.
The antenna connector is one with the antenna body - this design further increases the resistance of the antenna to external conditions.
With a length of only 480&nbsp;mm, this antenna will be the best fit for your LPWAN gateway or outdoor deployed RAK Hotspot.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
This antenna is designed to be directly mounted on the enclosure of the Gateway. It is suitable for the following RAK products:
- [RAK7240](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak7240-outdoor-lpwan-gateway?utm_source=RAK7240WisGateEdgePrime&utm_medium=Document&utm_campaign=BuyFromStore)
- [RAK7249](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak7249-diy-outdoor-gateway?utm_source=RAK7249Max&utm_medium=Document&utm_campaign=BuyFromStore)

The antenna is also compatible with the following:
