1. If you have already installed the outdoor enclosure onto the pole, you need to remove the two M6*12 screws that fasten it on both sides first.

2. Install the screws on the left and right holders, each holder has two screws. It is important to reserve a gap of 3-4&nbsp;mm between the screw and the holder, so do not tighten them at this point.
