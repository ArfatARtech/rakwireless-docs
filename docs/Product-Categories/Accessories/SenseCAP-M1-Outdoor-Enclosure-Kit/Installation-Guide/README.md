# Installation Guide

In this guide, the process of assembling and mounting an outdoor case for the SenseCAP M1 will be shown step by step. Strict adherence to the steps guarantees a secured and durable outdoor casing.

## Kit Inclusion

The package includes all the necessary parts for this project, without the SenseCAP M1 itself.

1. PoE injector, power cord for the PoE injector, and PoE splitter
2. Zip ties, PVC tape, and waterproof tape
3. Pole mounting kit
4. Antenna cable type RG316, with N-type female to SMA female connectors for LoRa antenna. 
5. Cover sticker (for the LEDs)
6. RAKBox-GW-4

## Assembly

A detailed explanation of the procedure of putting the SenseCAP M1 inside the RAKBox-GW-4.

1. Open the RAKBox-GW-4 enclosure and remove the top cover. 

2. At the opening marked ‚ÄúLoRa1‚Äù, position and assemble the antenna connector. Use the remaining plugs to close the openings, as shown on Figure 1.

9. Close the top cover with twelve M4*12 screws. 


## Installation

Instructions on mounting and securing the mounting kit to the enclosure and the bearing pole.

1. Fix the device bracket on the bottom of the enclosure with four M6*12 screws, as shown in Figure 10.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

 The diameter of the pole that is supported by the brackets is 50-100&nbsp;mm. If the pole diameter is more than this value, the steel strips can be used. The standard mounting kit does not include steel strips. If needed, they should be purchased separately.

3. Hang up the enclosure and fasten it with two M6*12 screws.

## Connecting the PoE Adapter

1. Connect the Ethernet cable from the enclosure to the Ethernet port labeled POE on the adapter.

2. Connect an Ethernet cable from your LAN network to the Ethernet port labeled LAN on the adapter.

3. Connect one end of the power cord to the adapter. Connect the other end of the power cord to a power outlet.

## Weather Protection

To better protect the Ethernet cable gland and the antenna connector from the weather, you need to cover them with PVC tape. 

1. Clean the surface area of the connector that will be wrapped. Wrap a layer of PVC tape with a 50% overlap according to the rotation direction of the connector. Continue wrapping the PVC tape to about 10&nbsp;mm below the end of the connector.

2. Cut off about 50&nbsp;cm waterproof tape. Stretch it to double the length. Wrap three layers around the connector with a 50% overlap. Hold the tape in place with your hand for a few seconds.

3. Wrap three additional layers with PVC tape with natural uncoiling force and a 50% overlap. Make sure to cover the head and the tail of the connector.
