# 863-870 MHz 5 dBi Fiberglass Antenna Datasheet

## Overview

### Product Description

RAK‚Äôs 5 dBi fiberglass antenna is an outdoor, high-performance antenna, designed to withstand harsh outdoor conditions. It is specially designed for LoRa¬Æ in the 863-870MHz band ‚Äì EU868, IN865, and RU864. 

The antenna connector is one with the antenna body - this design further increases the resistance of the antenna to external conditions.

With a length of only 480 mm, this antenna will be the best fit for your LPWAN Gateway or outdoor deployed RAK Hotspot Miner.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
This antenna is designed to be directly mounted on the enclosure of the Gateway. It is suitable for [RAK7240](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisGate/RAK7240/Overview/) and [RAK7249](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisGate/RAK7249/Overview/). The antenna is also compatible with [Outdoor Enclosure for RAK Hotspot Miner](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/Accessories/Outdoor-Enclosure-Kit/Overview/#rak-hotspot-miner-outdoor-case), [Bobcat Outdoor Enclosure Kit](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/Accessories/Bobcat-Enclosure-Kit/Overview/), and [Antenna Magnetic Base](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/Accessories/RAKA0C52/Overview/).
