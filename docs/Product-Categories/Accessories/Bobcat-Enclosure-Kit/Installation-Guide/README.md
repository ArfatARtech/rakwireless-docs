## Assembly

A detailed explanation of the procedure of putting the Bobcat Miner 300 inside the RAKBox-GW-4.

1. Open the RAKBox-GW-4 enclosure and remove the top cover.

2. At the opening marked ‚ÄúLoRa1‚Äù, position and assemble the antenna connector. Use the remaining plugs to close the openings, as shown in Figure 4.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
Because of the different variants regarding the connector of the Bobcat Miner 300 (SMA or RP-SMA), an adapter is provided that will guarantee the compatibility of the enclosure to your miner regardless of the connector. When assembling your Outdoor Enclosure Kit, keep in mind that the adapter may be needed at this step.

7. Fix the plate with the miner inside the enclosure with four M3*6 screws.

8. Insert the Ethernet cable through the cable gland. Plug the RJ45 Network cable coming out from the cable gland to the PoE splitter's RJ45 port. Then, fasten the cable gland's body to the enclosure and tighten the lock nut.

9. Close the top cover with twelve M4*12 screws.


## Installation

Instructions on mounting and securing the mounting kit to the enclosure and the bearing pole.

1. Fix the device bracket on the bottom of the enclosure with four M6*12 screws as shown in Figure 13.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
The diameter of the pole that is supported by the brackets is 50-100&nbsp;mm. If the pole diameter is more than this value, the steel strips can be used. The standard mounting kit does not include steel strips. If needed, they should be purchased separately.
:::

3. Hang up the enclosure and fasten it with two M6*12 screws.

## Connecting the PoE Adapter

1. Connect the Ethernet cable from the enclosure to the Ethernet port labeled POE on the adapter.
2. Connect an Ethernet cable from your LAN network to the Ethernet port labeled LAN on the adapter.
3. Connect one end of the power cord to the adapter. Connect the other end of the power cord to a power outlet.

## Weather Protection

To better protect the Ethernet cable gland and the antenna connector from the weather, you need to cover them with PVC tape.

1. Clean the surface area of the connector that will be wrapped. Wrap a layer of PVC tape with a 50% overlap according to the rotation direction of the connector. Continue wrapping the PVC tape to about 10&nbsp;mm below the end of the connector.

2. Cut off about 50&nbsp;cm waterproof tape. Stretch it to double the length. Wrap three layers around the connector with a 50% overlap. Hold the tape in place with your hand for a few seconds.

3. Wrap three additional layers with PVC tape with natural uncoiling force and a 50% overlap. Make sure to cover the head and the tail of the connector.
