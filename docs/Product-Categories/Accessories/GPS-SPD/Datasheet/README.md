# GPS SPD Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

This lightning arrestor connects between the antenna and the GPS receiver. A surge protection device for securing against transients, over-voltage, and surge currents induced by bolts of lightning.

For the purpose of protecting the indoor equipment and circuitry connected to the LoRa gateway, you need to install an Ethernet port Surge Protection Device (SPD).

By adopting a high pass filter, this product can effectively suppress the low-frequency interference induced by lightning while letting through the GPS signal with low insertion loss. A transient suppression device (TSD) and a gas discharge tube (GDT) are adopted for the protection of the DC feed circuit
### Features

- Impedance: **50&nbsp;Ω**
- Frequency Range: **1500-1650&nbsp;MHz**
- Power Loss: **≤ 0.3&nbsp;dB**
- Ingress Protection: **IP65**
