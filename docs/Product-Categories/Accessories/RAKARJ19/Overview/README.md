# RAKARJ19 868MHz Gray Antenna

## Product Description

HWR Series ½-wave center-fed dipole antennas deliver outstanding performance in a rugged and cosmetically attractive package. The articulating base allows the antenna to tilt 90 degrees and rotate 360 degrees. The antenna’s internal counterpoise eliminates external ground plane dependence and maximizes performance. HWR Series antennas attach via a Part 15 compliant RP-SMA connector.
