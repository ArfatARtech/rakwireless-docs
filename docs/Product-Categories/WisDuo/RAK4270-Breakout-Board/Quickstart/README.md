### Connecting to The Things Network (TTN)

In this section, a practical exercise will be performed to show how to connect the RAK4270 Breakout Board to The Things Network (TTN) platform. 

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/RAK4270-breakout-board/quickstart/connecting-to-ttn/4.ttn-context.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="RAK4270 Breakout Board in the context of the TTN"
/>

As shown in Figure 6, the RAK4270 Breakout Board is one of the devices located on the left side. In the context of an IoT solution, the objective is to deploy devices to sense relevant process variables and transmit the data to the backend servers located in the cloud. The data will be processed and integrated as part of a larger solution that ultimately could generate efficiency, traceability and predictability capacity among others.

The RAK4270 Breakout Board can be part of this ecosystem, and the objective of this section is to demonstrate how simple it is to send data to the TTN using the LoRaWAN protocol. To achieve this, the RAK4270 Breakout Board must be located inside of the coverage of a LoRaWAN gateway. 


<b>Sign up and login</b>

If you don't have an account yet, head on to the [TTN website](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) and create one. Once done, login to your account and go to the Console. 

<rk-img

  width="100%"
  caption="Adding an Application"
/>

* Here are the things that you should take note in adding an application:

    * **Application ID** - this will be the unique id of your application in the Network. Note that the characters should be in lower case, no spaces are allowed.
    * **Description** - this is a short and concise human readable description of your application.
    * **Application EUI** - this will be generated automatically by The Things Network for convenience.
    * **Handler Registration** - handler you want to register this application to.


3. After you fill in the necessary information, press the "**Add application**" button at the bottom of this page. If you see similar page as shown in Figure 11, then you have successfully registered your application.

#### LoRaWAN Join Mode


The LoRaWAN specification defines that to join in a LoRaWAN network, each end-device has to be personalized and activated. Activation can be done either via Over-The-Air-Activation (OTAA) or Activation-By-Personalization (ABP). In OTAA, the previously personalized end-device is activated when is deployed or reset. On the other hand, in ABP, the personalization and activation are done as a single step. 


Hence, this is referred to as the ‚Äú**Join Mode**". LoRaWAN allows the OTAA mode and the ABP mode. In this section, the configuration process of these two modes is explained, both on the platform side and the node side.


##### OTAA Mode

###### Configure the OTAA Mode on the Platform

As shown in Figure 14, the default activation mode in TTN is the OTAA mode. Therefore, no further actions are required in the platform side. 

###### Configure the OTAA Mode on the RAK4270 Breakout Board

The RAK4270 Breakout Board supports a series of AT commands to configure its internal parameters and control the functionalities of the module. Physically, the module exposes a serial interface through the USB connector. 

To set up the RAK4270 Breakout Board to join the TTN using OTAA, start by connecting the RAK4270 Breakout Board to the Computer (see Figure 1) and open the RAK Serial Port Tool. Wait for the communication to start. It is recommended to test the serial communication and verify the current configuration by sending either of these two AT commands:

```
at+set_config=device:restart
```

```
at+version
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/RAK4270-breakout-board/quickstart/connecting-to-ttn/3.command-response.png"
  width="40%"
  caption="at+version command response"
/>


As an example, these are the list of the parameters you need to configure in RAK4270 Breakout Board: 

- LoRa join mode: **OTAA**
- LoRa class: **Class A**
- LoRa region: **EU868** 
- Device EUI: **5e9d1e0857cf25f1**
- Application EUI: **5e9d1e0857cf25f1**
- Application Key: **f921d50cd7d02ee3c5e6142154f274b2**


1. Set the LoRa join mode to OTAA.

```
at+set_config=lora:join_mode:0
```

2. Set the LoRa class to Class A.

```
at+set_config=lora:class:0
```

3. Set the frequency/region to EU868.

* Refer in the [RAK4270 Breakout Board Datasheet](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK4270-Breakout-Board/Datasheet/#rf-characteristics) for the list of supported frequencies.


```
at+set_config=lora:region:EU868
```

4. Set the Device EUI.

```
at+set_config=lora:dev_eui:5e9d1e0857cf25f1
```

5. Set the Application EUI.

```
at+set_config=lora:app_eui:5e9d1e0857cf25f1
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:

The Device EUI parameter is not needed for the ChirpStack platform; therefore, you will use the same ID as the Device EUI. Otherwise, the firmware will fail connecting to the network server. 

:::

6. Set the Application Key.

```
at+set_config=lora:app_key:f921d50cd7d02ee3c5e6142154f274b2
```

  width="40%"
  caption="Configuring LoRa Parameters"
/>

:::tip üìù NOTE:

After configuring all the parameters, you need to reset your RAK4270 Breakout Board to save the parameters.

:::

7. After resetting, join in OTAA mode.

```
at+join
```

After 5 or 6 seconds, if the request was successfully received by a LoRa gateway, then you should see the messages shown in Figure 17.

8. Try to send a message from the RAK4270 Breakout Board.

```
at+send:lora:2:1234567890
```

  width="100%"
  caption="OTAA Test Sample Data Sent Viewed in TTN"
/>


##### ABP Mode

###### Configure the ABP mode on the Platform


If the ABP mode is preferred, then the TTN platform needs to be configured first accordingly. At TTN, once a device is created, you can select the ‚Äú**SETTINGS**‚Äù section of the ‚Äú**DEVICE**‚Äù and switch the ‚Äú**Activation Method**‚Äù.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/RAK4270-breakout-board/quickstart/connecting-to-ttn/17.abp-mode.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="ABP Activation in TTN"
/>

* For ABP mode, the TTN parameters needed are the following:

  * **Device Address**
  * **Network Session Key**
  * **App Session Key**

:::tip üìù NOTE:
These fields can be left empty in the form and TTN will complete them with random values, in other cases, you can complete them with specific values.

  width="100%"
  caption="ABP Mode Parameters"
/>



###### Configure the ABP mode on the RAK4270 Breakout Board

To set up the RAK4270 Breakout Board to join the TTN using ABP, start by connecting the RAK4270 Breakout Board to the computer via a USB to UART converter (see Figure 2) and open the RAK Serial Port Tool. Wait for the communication to start. It is recommended to test the serial communication by sending either of these two AT commands:

```
at+set_config=device:restart
```

```
at+version
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/RAK4270-breakout-board/quickstart/connecting-to-ttn/3.command-response.png"
  width="40%"
  caption="at+version command response"
/>

As an example, these are the list of the parameters you need to configure in RAK4270 Breakout Board: 

- LoRa join mode: **ABP**
- LoRa class: **Class A**
- LoRa region: **EU868** 
- Device address: **26011af9**
- Network Session Key: **c280cb8d1df688bc18601a97025c5488**
- Application Session Key: **4d42ec5caf97f03d833cdaf5003f69e1**



1. Set the LoRa join mode to ABP.

```
at+set_config=lora:join_mode:1
```
2. Set the LoRa class to Class A.

```
at+set_config=lora:class:0
```

3. Set the frequency/region to EU868.

- Refer in the [RAK4270 Breakout Board Datasheet](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK4270-Breakout-Board/Datasheet/#rf-characteristics) for the list of supported frequencies.

```
at+set_config=lora:region:EU868
```

4. Set the Device Address.

```
at+set_config=lora:dev_addr:26011af9

:::tip üìù NOTE:

After configuring all the parameters, you need to reset your RAK4270 Breakout Board to save the parameters.

:::


7. After resetting, join in ABP mode.

```
at+join
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:

By using the ABP mode in LoRaWAN, it doesn‚Äôt require to join a network before sending a LoRaWAN package. But to keep the consistency of internal states of the firmware of the RAK4270 Breakout Board, it still required to send at+join command in the ABP mode. This time, the firmware should reply almost immediately with an ‚ÄúOK‚Äù.

:::

8. Try to send a data from the RAK4270 Breakout Board to TTN in ABP mode.

```
at+send:lora:2:1234567890 
```

/>

Then, go to the TTN Console to confirm that the message was properly received.



### Connecting with ChirpStack

The ChirpStack or previously known as LoRaServer project provides open-source components for building LoRaWAN networks. Like the case of TTN, the RAK4270 Breakout Module is located in the periphery and transmit the data to the backend servers through a LoRa gateway. Learn more about [ChirpStack](https://www.chirpstack.io/).


<rk-img

#### LoRaWAN Join Mode

In LoRaWAN, there are two (2) ways a node can connect itself to the LoRaWAN network. This is referred to as **Join Mode**. LoRaWAN allows both the OTAA mode and the ABP mode. In this section, the configuration process of these two modes, both on the platform side and the node side, will be explained.


##### OTAA Mode

###### Configure the OTAA Mode on the Platform


1. If you have selected ‚Äú**DeviceProfile_OTAA**‚Äù as shown in Figure 34, then after the device is created, an Application Key must be also created for this device. 

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4270-breakout-board/quickstart/31.otaa.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Chirpstack OTAA Activation"
/>

2. A previously created Application Key can be entered here, or a new one can be generated automatically by clicking the icon highlighted in red in Figure 35.

  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4270-breakout-board/quickstart/32.otaa-set-device-keys.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Chirpstack OTAA Set Device Keys"
/>

3. Once the Application Key is added in the form, the process can be finalized by clicking on the ‚Äú**SET DEVICE-KEYS**‚Äù button. 

* As shown in Figure 36, a new device should be listed in the DEVICES tab. The most important parameters, such as the Device EUI are shown in the summary.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4270-breakout-board/quickstart/33.list-device.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Chirpstack OTAA List of Device in the Device Tab"
/>


4. To end the process, it is a good practice to review that the Application Key is properly associated with this device. The Application Key can be verified in the **KEYS(OTAA)** tab as shown in Figure 37.


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4270-breakout-board/quickstart/34.application-key.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Application Key Associated with the New Device"
/>


:::tip üìù NOTE:

Standard OTAA mode requires the **Device EUI**, **Application Key**, and the **Application EUI**. But in the ChirpStack‚Äôs implementation, only the Device EUI and the Application Key are mandatory. The Application EUI is neither required nor recorded in the Application tab. Nevertheless, the Application EUI is a mandatory parameter in the RAK4270 Breakout Board firmware. To resolve this mismatch, you can reuse the Device EUI as the Application EUI during the configuration in the side of the node. 

:::

###### Configure the OTAA mode on the RAK4270 Breakout Board


The RAK4270 Breakout Board supports a series of [AT commands](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK4270-Module/AT-Command-Manual/#rak4270-at-command-manual) to configure its internal parameters and control the functionalities of the module. 

To set up the RAK4270 Breakout to join ChirpStack using OTAA, start by connecting the board to the computer (see Figure 2) and open the RAK Serial Port  Tool. Wait for the communication to start. It is recommended to test the serial communication by sending either of these two AT commands:


```
at+get_config=lora:status
```

```
at+version
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4270-breakout-board/quickstart/3.command-response.png"
  width="40%"
  caption="at+version command response"
/>

As an example, these are the list of the parameters you need to configure in RAK4270 Breakout Board: 

- LoRa join mode: **OTAA**
- LoRa class: **Class A**
- LoRa region: **EU868** 
- Device EUI: **5e9d1e0857cf25f1**
- Application EUI: **5e9d1e0857cf25f1**
- Application Key: **f921d50cd7d02ee3c5e6142154f274b2**


1. Set the LoRa join mode to OTAA.

```
at+set_config=lora:join_mode:0
```

2. Set the LoRa class to Class A.

```
at+set_config=lora:class:0
```

3. Set the frequency/region to EU868.

This concludes the exercise to send data in the OTAA mode.


##### ABP Mode

###### Configure the ABP Mode on the Platform

During the registration of a new device, if you select **DeviceProfile_ABP**‚Äù, as shown in Figure 44, then the ChirpStack platform will assume that this device will join to the LoRaWAN network using the ABP mode. 

:::tip üìù NOTE:

Check ‚Äú**Disable counting frame verification**‚Äù. During the test, when the module is restarted, the frame counting number will be also be restarted from zero. This would cause a synchronization problem with the ChirpStack server treating it as a replay attack. For the testing purpose, it is safe to disable this feature, but remember to activate it in a production environment.

After selecting the ABP mode, the following parameters appear in the Activation tab: 

*	**Device address**
*	**Network Session Key**
*	**Application Session Key**

* The parameters can be generated as random numbers by the platform or can be set with user values. Once these parameters are filled properly, the process is completed by clicking on the ‚Äú**ACTIVATE DEVICE**‚Äù button.

###### Configure the ABP mode on the RAK4270 Breakout Board

In the following steps, you will configure the RAK4270 Breakout Board to work in the ABP mode. To set up the RAK4270 Breakout Board to join ChirpStack using ABP, start by connecting the board to the computer (see Figure 2) and open the RAK Serial Port Tool. Wait for the communication to start. It is recommended to test the serial communication by sending either of these two AT commands:

```
at+get_config=lora:status
```

```
at+version
```


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4270-breakout-board/quickstart/3.command-response.png"
  width="40%"
  caption="at+version command response"
/>

As an example, these are the list of the parameters you need to configure in RAK4270 Breakout Board: 

- LoRa join mode: **ABP**
- LoRa class: **Class A**
- LoRa region: **EU868** 
- Device address: **26011af9**
- Network Session Key: **c280cb8d1df688bc18601a97025c5488**
- Application Session Key: **4d42ec5caf97f03d833cdaf5003f69e1**

1. Set LoRa join mode to ABP.

```
at+set_config=lora:join_mode:1
```

2. Set LoRa class to Class A.

```
at+set_config=lora:class:0
```

3. Set the frequency/region to EU868. 

- Refer in the [RAK4270 Breakout Board Datasheet](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK4270-Breakout-Board/Datasheet/#rf-characteristics) for the list of supported frequencies.

```
at+set_config=lora:region:EU868
```

4. Set the Device Address. 

```
at+set_config=lora:dev_addr:26011af9
```

5. Set the Network Session Key.

```
at+set_config=lora:nwks_key:c280cb8d1df688bc18601a97025c5488
```

6. Set the Application Session Key.

```
at+set_config=lora:apps_key:4d42ec5caf97f03d833cdaf5003f69e1
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:

After configuring all the parameters, you need to reset your RAK4270 Breakout Board to save the parameters.

:::

7. After resetting RAK4270 Breakout Board, join in ABP mode.

```
at+join
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:

By using the ABP mode in LoRaWAN protocol, it doesn‚Äôt require to join a network before sending LoRaWAN package. But to keep the consistency of internal states of the firmware of the RAK4270 Breakout Board, it still required to send at+join command in the ABP mode. This time, the firmware should reply almost immediately with an ‚ÄúOK‚Äù.

:::


8. Try to send a data from RAK4270 Breakout Board to ChirpStack.

```
at+send=lora:2:1234567890 
```

### LoRa P2P Mode

This section will show you how to set up and connect two RAK4270 Breakout Board units to work in the LoRa P2P mode. You will be using EU868 as your frequency, although it is applicable also to other standard bands.

1. Two RAK4270 Breakout Board units shall be set to operate on EU868 frequency. 

2. The setup of the RAK4270 board units is done by connecting then with a general-purpose computer through the UART port. The setup of each RAK4270 Breakout Board can be done separately but testing the LoRa P2P mode will require having both units connected simultaneously to its respective UART port. This could be one computer with two USB ports or two computers with one USB port each.

3. Set the RAK4270 Breakout Board to work in LoRa P2P mode. Open the RAK Serial Port Tool and send the following command:

```
at+set_config=lora:work_mode:1
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4270-breakout-board/quickstart/46.lora-p2p.png"
  width="40%"
  caption="P2P Initialization"
/>


4. Then, configure LoRa P2P parameters for both of them.


```
at+set_config=lorap2p:XXX:Y:Z:A:B:C
```


For this example, the LoRa parameters are the following:

- Link frequency: **869525000&nbsp;Hz**
- Spreading factor: **7**
- Bandwidth: **125&nbsp;kHz**
- Coding Rate: **4/5**
- Preamble Length: **5**
- Power: **5&nbsp;dBm**

:::tip üìù NOTE:

Refer to the [Configuring Using AT Commands](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK4270-Module/AT-Command-Manual/#rak4270-at-command-manual) section to learn more about the definition of the parameters used.

:::

Hence, it is translated into the following RAK4270 Breakout Board AT command and send to both units.

```
at+set_config=lorap2p:869525000:7:0:1:5:5
```

  width="40%"
  caption="Configuring P2P in both RAK4270 Breakout Board"
/>

5. Set the transmission mode of the module. Unit 1 is configured as the sender, and Unit 2 is set to the receiver by AT command.

```
at+set_config=lorap2p:transfer_mode:2
```

```
at+set_config=lorap2p:transfer_mode:1
```

6. Try to send a message from Unit 1 to Unit 2. 

```
at+send=lorap2p:1234567890
```
