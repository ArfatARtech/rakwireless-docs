# RAK4270 Breakout Board Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

**RAK4270 Breakout Board** is a simple board specially designed to facilitate the external connection of RAK4270 pins. The main purpose is to access the pins of the stamp module over two (2) rows of 2.54&nbsp;mm headers. Hence, it is convenient to debug the RAK4270 Breakout Board.     

The RAK4270 Breakout Board includes a **STM32L071 MCU** and a **SX1262 LoRa chip**, which supports eight spreading factors (**SF5 ~ SF12**) and signal bandwidth that can be adjusted between **7.8&nbsp;kHz** to **500&nbsp;kHz**. It has Ultra-Low Power Consumption of 2.31&nbsp;ŒºA (down to 1.61&nbsp;ŒºA @ 2.0&nbsp;V) in sleep mode, but during the Transmit mode, it can reach the maximum output power of **22&nbsp;dBm**. As a receiver, it can achieve a sensitivity of **-148&nbsp;dBm**.    

The module complies with the LoRaWAN 1.0.2 protocol, so it can be used for implementing LoRa networks or Lora point to point communications. The module is suitable for various applications that require long-range data acquisition and low power consumption, such as smart meters, supply chain and logistics tracking, agricultural sensors, smart cities, etc.    

This module is expected to be controlled by an external controller through its UART interface by sending a set of AT commands. These AT commands control not only the state of this module but also set the LoRaWan communication parameters and payloads (see RAK [AT Command Manual](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK4270-Module/AT-Command-Manual/)).

#### Interfaces

##### SWD Programming Interface

To program the breakout board with the DAPLink tool, the following pins are required:

| **Connector/Pin** | **Name** | **I/O** | **Description**                  | **Alternate functions**       |
| :---------------: | -------- | :-----: | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
|       J1 5        | SWDIO    |   I/O   | Programming (STM32L071KBU6 PA13) | SWDIO, LPUART1_RX             |
|       J1 6        | SWCLK    |   I/O   | Programming (STM32L071KBU6 PA14) | SWCLK, USART2_TX, LPUART1_TX  |
|       J2 1        | VDD      |    -    | DC3V3                            | Supply voltage 2.0~3.3&nbsp;V |
|       J2 4        | GND      |    -    | Ground                           | -                             |
|       J2 5        | MCU_NRST |   I/O   | MCU reset (STM32L071KBU6 NRST)   | -                             |

:::tip üìù NOTE:
It is recommended to keep these GPIO's unconnected and not to use them to connect sensors, buttons, or other external components.
:::

##### UART Port

There are two UART ports on the RAK4270 Breakout Board. UART2_RX and UART2_TX are used as a command port and UART1_TX and UART1_RX are used as a command or upgrade port. It is recommended to connect UART2 to an external MCU and use UART1 for debugging and flashing.

##### I2C Port

I2C_SCL and I2C_SDA are the I2C port. Depending on the external device connected to it, it might be necessary to add 10&nbsp;kOhm pull-up resistors to these lines.

##### RF Port

The RF port is by default equipped with a SMA connector. If you need an IPEX connector, contact the customer service in advance. RAKwireless will replace the SMA connector with an IPEX type connector.
