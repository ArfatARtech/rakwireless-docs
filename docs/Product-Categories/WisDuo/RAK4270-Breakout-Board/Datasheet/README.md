# RAK4270 Breakout Board Datasheet

## Overview

## Description

**RAK4270 Breakout Board** is a simple board specially designed to facilitate the external connection of RAK4270 pins. The main purpose is to access the pins of the stamp module over 2 rows of 2.54mm headers. It is convenient for users to debug the RAK4270 module.     

The RAK4270 LoRa Module includes a STM32L071 MCU and a SX1262 LoRa chip, which supports 8 spreading factors (SF5 ~ SF12) and signal bandwidth that can be adjusted between 7.8 kHz to 500 kHz. It has ultra-low power consumption of 1.5uA in Sleep mode, but during the Transmit mode, it can reach the maximum output power of 22 dBm. As a receiver it can achieve a sensitivity of -138 dBm.    

The module complies with the LoRaWAN 1.0.2 protocol, so it can be used for implementing LoRa networks or Lora point to point communications. The module is suitable for various applications that require long range data acquisition and low power consumption, such as: smart meters, supply chain and logistics tracking, agricultural sensors, smart cities, etc.    

This module is expected to be controlled by an external controller through its UART interface by sending a set of AT commands. These AT commands control not only the state of this module but also set the LoRaWan communication parameters and payloads (see RAK AT Command Manual).

#### Interfaces

##### SWD Programming Interface

To program the breakout board with the DAPLink tool, the following pins are required:

| **Connector/Pin** | **Name** | **I/O** | **Description** | **Alternate functions** |
| :-: | -- | :-: | -- | -- |
| J1 5 | SWDIO | I/O | Programming (STM32L071KBU6 PA13) | SWDIO, LPUART1_RX | 
| J1 6 | SWCLK | I/O | Programming (STM32L071KBU6 PA14) | SWCLK, USART2_TX, LPUART1_TX | 
| J2 1 | VDD | - | DC3V3 | Supply voltage 2.0~3.3V | 
| J2 4 | GND | - | Ground | - | 
| J2 5 | MCU_NRST | I/O | MCU reset (STM32L071KBU6 NRST) | - | 

:::tip üìù NOTE:
It is recommended to keep these GPIO's unconnected and not to use them to connect sensors, buttons or other external components.
:::

##### UART Port

There are two UART ports on the RAK4270 module. UART2_RX and UART2_TX are used as a command port and UART1_TX and UART1_RX are used as a command or upgrade port. It is recommended to connect UART2 to an external MCU and use UART1 for debugging and flashing.

##### I2C Port

I2C_SCL and I2C_SDA are the I2C port. Depending on the external device connected to it, it might be necessary to add 10kOhm pullup resistors these lines.

##### RF Port

The RF port is by default equipped with a SMA connector. If you need an IPEX connector, please contact customer service in advance. RAKwireless will replace the SMA connector with an IPEX type connector.
