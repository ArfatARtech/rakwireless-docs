To flash a new firmware, use RAKDAP1, a SWD adapter. It requires the Python3 tool pyocd installed on your computer.

### Flash the Firmware Using DAPLink and RAKDAP1

1. Install pyOCD.

Refer to [RAKDAP1 Flash and Debug Tool](/Product-Categories/Accessories/RAKDAP1-Flash-and-Debug-Tool/Overview/#rakdap1-flash-and-debug-tool).

2. Check Support Package installation for RAK4260.
```
pyocd list -t -n atsaml21j18a
```

## Interfacing with the RAK4260 Evaluation Board

To check if you have successfully flashed the custom firmware provided by RAKwireless correctly,  download the [**RAK Serial Port Tool**](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/en/LoRa/Tools).

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
Before powering the RAK4260 Evaluation Board, you should install the LoRa antenna first. Not doing so might damage the board.
:::

1. Connect your RAK4260 Evaluation Board in your Windows PC using the provided micro usb cable.

  width="60%"
  caption="RAK4260 Evaluation Board to Laptop Connection"
/>

2. Open the RAK Serial Port Tool.

  width="90%"
  caption="RAK Serial Port Tool"
/>

3. To find the correct COM Port number for your device, go to Device Manager by pressing **Windows + R**, and then type `devmgmt.msc`. Or, search for Device Manager in the Start Menu.

  width="100%"
  caption="Device Manager"
/>

4. Look for Ports (COM & LPT) and find the name **USB-SERIAL CH340**. Take note of the COM Port Number.

:::tip üìù NOTE
If you didn't find any port with the name USB-Serial CH340, make sure you have installed the CH340 Drivers in your Windows PC.
:::

5. Choose the Correct Port Number and Baud rate from the Device Manager, then click the **OPEN** button.

## Connecting to The Things Network (TTN)

In this section, you will be connecting the RAK4260 Evaluation Board to The Things Network (TTN). If you don't have an account yet, head on to [The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) website and create one. Once done, log in to your account and go to the console.

<rk-img

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4260-evaluation-board/quickstart/5ttn/ttn-console-page.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="TTN Console Page"

- Choose "**APPLICATIONS**"

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4260-evaluation-board/quickstart/5ttn/application-page.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Application Page"
/>

### Adding an Application

1. Click the "**add application**" button

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4260-evaluation-board/quickstart/5ttn/add-application.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Application Page"
/>

2. Here are the things that you should take note in adding an application:

   - **Application ID** - a unique id of your application in the Network. Note that the characters should be in lower case, and no spaces are allowed.
   - **Description** - a short and concise human readable description of your application.
   - **Application EUI** - this will be generated automatically by The Things Network for convenience.
   - **Handler Registration** - handler you want to register this application to.

3. After you fill in the necessary information, press the "**Add application**" button at the bottom of the page. If you see the same page as shown in Figure 10, this means that you have successfully registered your application.

  width="100%"
  caption="Application Overview"
/>

### Register Device

1. Scroll down until you see the Devices section, or you can also click the "**Devices**" button at the top.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4260-evaluation-board/quickstart/5ttn/device-section.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Device Section"

2. Click "**Register device**".

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4260-evaluation-board/quickstart/5ttn/add-device.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Add your Device"
/>

3. Here are the things that you should take note in registering your device:

   - **Device ID** - this is the unique identifier for your RAK4260 Evaluation Board in your application. You need to enter this manually.
   - **Device EUI** - this is the unique identifier for your device in the network. You can change it later, if you want.

4. Click the following icon and the Device EUI will be automatically generated. The App Key should be in auto generation mode by default.

5. Lastly, click the Register button. Now, your device is registered under the corresponding application.

## OTAA Mode

1. After connecting the device and choosing the appropriate COM Port and Baud rate, press the "**Reset button**" on your RAK5005 Baseboard Module. If everything works perfectly, you should see the same message shown in Figure 19:


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4260-breakout-board/quickstart/ttn/startup-default-output.png"
  width="60%"
  caption="Serial Port Tool Successful Connection"
/>

2. Choose Option 1 "Send Join Request" then click on **SEND** button.

  width="100%"
  caption="Serial Port Tool Successful Connection"
/>

3. The default join mode is OTAA, and the default frequency is EU868. After resetting it, RAK4260 will join automatically because the dev_eui, app_eui, and app_key have been configured in the source code.

```

:::tip üìù NOTE
You must choose one LoRaWAN activation method and modify the join parameter's definition if you want. The join parameters and activation methods are defined in the [**conf_app.h**](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAK4260-LoRaNode-demo/blob/master/APPS_ENDDEVICE_DEMO1/src/config/conf_app.h) file.

5. Figure 18 shows data received by the TTN.

6. The Microchip Studio LoRaWAN examples are based on [SAMR34 Xplained Pro](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/dm320111), but RAK260 did not adopt the same GPIO pinout. If you need to develop a new LoRaWAN application, refer to RAK4260 GPIO pins defined in the [**samr34_xplained_pro.h**](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAK4260-LoRaNode-demo/blob/master/APPS_ENDDEVICE_DEMO1/src/ASF/sam0/boards/samr34_xplained_pro.h) file.
