### Connecting to The Things Network (TTN)

In this section, a practical exercise will be performed to show how to connect the RAK4600 to The Things Network (TTN) platform.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/ttn-context.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="RAK4600 in the context of the TTN"
/>

As shown in Figure 13, the RAK4600 is one of the devices located on the left side. In the context of an IoT solution, the objective is to deploy devices to sense the relevant process variables and transmit the data to the backend servers located in the cloud. The data will be processed and integrated as part of a larger solution that, ultimately, could generate efficiency, traceability, predictability capacity among others.

The RAK4600 can be part of this ecosystem, and the objective of this section is to demonstrate how simple is to send data to the TTN using the LoRaWAN protocol. To achieve this, the RAK4600 must be located inside of the coverage of a LoRaWAN gateway. 


<b>Sign up and login</b>

If you don't have an account yet, head on to the [TTN website](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) and create one. Once done, login to your account and go to the Console.

  width="100%"
  caption="Application Page"
/>

2. Click on the **Add application** link.


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/adding-application.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Adding an Application"
/>

* Here are the things that you should take note in adding an application:

    * **Application ID**: This will be the unique id of your application in the Network. Note that the characters should be in lower case, no spaces are allowed.
    * **Description**: This is a short and concise human readable description of your application.
    * **Application EUI**: This will be generated automatically by The Things Network for convenience.
    * **Handler Registration**: The handler you want to register this application to.


3. After you fill in the necessary information, press the **Add application** button at the bottom of this page. 


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/application-overview.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Application Overview"
/>

<b>Register a New Device</b>

Before RAK4600 can communicate via The Things Network, you need to register it with an application.

1. Scroll down until you see the Devices section or you can click the **DEVICES** button at the top. 
2. Then, register a new device by clicking on the **register device**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/devices.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Register your Device"
/>

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/adding-device.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Add your Device"
/>

The device ID must be unique for the application and must be completed with a lower case, alphanumeric characters. The rest of the parameters are very important for the LoRaWAN protocol:

* **Device EUI**
* **Application Key**
* **Application EUI**

The TTN platform can generate these parameters randomly by leaving those fields empty or the user can enter already existing values. 

3. Press the **Register** button at the bottom of this page to finish the process. The registration results will appear the same as shown in Figure 21.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/device-overview.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Device Overview"

#### LoRaWAN Join Mode

The LoRaWAN specification defines that to join in a LoRaWAN network, each end-device has to be personalized and activated. Activation can be done either via **Over-The-Air-Activation (OTAA)** or via **Activation-By-Personalization (ABP)**. In OTAA, the end-device previously personalized is activated when is deployed or reset. In ABP, personalization and activation are done as a single step.

##### OTAA mode

###### Configure the OTAA mode on the TTN platform

As shown in Figure 22, the default activation mode in TTN is the OTAA mode. Therefore, no further actions are required on the platform side. Three parameters from the TTN setup are used to configure the RAK4600: **Device EUI**, **Application EUI**, and **App Key**.

###### Configure the OTAA mode on the RAK4600

RAK4600 complies with the LoRaWAN 1.0.2 specification. By default, the LoRa join mode is **OTAA** and the LoRa Class is **Class A**.

To set up the RAK4600 to join the TTN using OTAA, start by connecting the RAK4600 to the Computer as shown in section [Interfacing with RAK4600](#interfacing-with-rak4600). Open the RAK Serial Port Tool and wait for the communication to start. It is recommended to test the serial communication by sending an AT command as:

```
at+get_config=lora:status
```
or 
```
at+version
```

### Connecting with ChirpStack

This section shows how to connect the RAK4600 to the ChirpStack platform. As described in the ChripsStack website:

‚ÄúThe ChirpStack open-source LoRaWAN Network Server stack provides open-source components for LoRaWAN networks. Together they form a ready-to-use solution including a user-friendly web-interface for device management and APIs for integration. The modular architecture makes it possible to integrate within existing infrastructures. All components are licensed under the MIT license and can be used for commercial purposes.‚Äù

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/chirpstack-architecture.png"
  width="60%"
  caption="RAK4600 in the context of the ChirpStack platform"
/>

The architecture of the ChirpStack platform is shown in Figure 33. Similar to the case of TTN, the RAK4600 is located in the periphery and will transmit the data to the backend servers through a LoRa gateway. More information about this architecture can be found at [https://www.chirpstack.io/](https://www.chirpstack.io/).

* In this section, it is assumed that you are using a RAK LoRa gateway, such as RAK7243. The gateway must be configured and registered previously to ChirpStack deployment. More information about that can be found at: [Connect the Gateway with Chirpstack](/Product-Categories/WisGate/RAK7243/Quickstart/#connect-the-gateway-with-chirpstack)

:::tip üìù NOTE:
The frequency band used in this example is EU868 which is supported by the high-frequency version of RAK4600.
:::

* This are the steps needed in order to send data to the ChirpStack platform from a RAK4600 module: 

  1. Create a new Application.
  2. Register a new device on the platform: 
  3. Configure the Join Mode:
      *	OTAA mode on the platform
      *	OTAA mode on the RAK4600
      *	ABP mode on the platform
      *	ABP mode on the RAK4600 
  4. Send data from the RAK4600 and receive it at the platform

The following section gives the details of each of these aforementioned steps. As usual, you must choose to use either ABP or OTAA mode to register the device to the network server.

#### Create a new Application

#### LoRaWAN Join Mode

The LoRaWAN specification defines that to join in a LoRaWAN network, each end-device has to be personalized and activated. Activation can be done either via Over-The-Air-Activation (OTAA) or via Activation-By-Personalization (ABP). In OTAA the end-device previously personalized is activated when is deployed or reset. In ABP, personalization and activation are done as a single step.

##### OTAA Mode

###### Configure the OTAA mode on the platform

1. If you have selected ‚Äú**device_profile_otaa**‚Äù, then after the device is created, an Application Key must be also created for this device. 

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/chirpstack-otaa.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Choosing OTAA mode in the device registration form"
/>

2. A previously created Application Key can be entered here or a new one can be generated automatically by clicking on the icon highlighted in red :

  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/chirpstack-otaa-appkey.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Application Key for the OTAA mode in the device registration form"
/>

3. Once the Application Key is added in the form, the process can be finalized by clicking on the ‚Äú**SET DEVICE-KEYS**‚Äù button. 

* As shown in Figure 44, a new device should be listed in the  ‚Äú**DEVICES**‚Äù tab. The most important parameters, such as the **Device EUI** are shown in the summary. 

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/chirpstack-deveui.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="New crated device listed in the DEVICES tab"
/>

4. To end the process, it is a good practice to review that the ‚Äú**Application Key**‚Äù is properly associated with this device. The ‚Äú**Application Key**‚Äù can be verified in the ‚Äú**KEYS(OTAA)**‚Äù tab.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/chirpstack-appkey.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Application Key associated to the new device"
/>

:::tip üìù NOTE:
Standard OTAA mode requires the Device EUI, Application Key, and the Application EUI, but in the ChirpStack‚Äôs implementation, only Device EUI and the Application Key are mandatory. The Application EUI is not required and is not recorded in the Application tab. Nevertheless, the Application EUI is a mandatory parameter in the RAK4600 module firmware. To resolve this mismatch, you can reuse the Device EUI as the Application EUI during the configuration in the side of the node. 
:::

###### Configure the OTAA mode on the RAK4600

RAK4600 complies with the LoRaWAN 1.0.2 specification. By default, the LoRa join mode is **OTAA** and the LoRa Class is **Class A**.

### LoRa P2P Mode

This section will show how to set and link two RAK4600 units to work in LoRa P2P mode.

1. The two RAK4600 units shall be set to operate at the same frequency, for this demonstration: **EU868**.

2. As shown in the previous sections, the setup of the RAK4600 units is done by connecting them with a general-purpose computer through the UART port as shown in section [Interfacing with RAK4600](#interfacing-with-rak4600). The setup of each RAK4600 can be done separately, but testing the LoRa P2P mode will require having both units connected simultaneously to a UART port (This could be one computer with 2 ports or 2 computers with one UART port each).

3. To set the RAK4600 to work in LoRa P2P mode, open the RAK Serial port tool and send the command as in Figure 56:

```
at+set_config=lora:work_mode:1
```
<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/p2p-work-mode.png"
  width="40%"
  caption="RAK4600 setting to LoRa P2P mode"
/>

4. Configure the LoRa P2P parameters for both units. The command for setting the parameters has the format.

```
at+set_config=lorap2p:XXX:Y:Z:A:B:C
```

* Based on the [AT Commands for RAK4600](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK4600-Module/LoRaWAN-P2P/AT-Command-Manual/), the parameters are:

  *	**XXX**: Frequency in Hz.
  *	**Y**: Spreading factor, [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].
  *	**Z**: Bandwidth, [0:125&nbsp;kHz, 1:250&nbsp;kHz, 2:500&nbsp;kHz]
  *	**A**: Coding Rate, [1: 4/5, 2: 4/6, 3: 4/7, 4: 4/8]
  *	**B**: Preamble Length, 5~65535.
  *	**C**: Power in dBm, 5~20.

For this example, the LoRa parameters are:
*	**Link frequency**: 869525000&nbsp;Hz
*	**Spreading factor**:7
*	**Bandwidth**: 125&nbsp;kHz
*	**Coding Rate**:4/5
*	**Preamble Length**: 5
*	**Power**: 5&nbsp;dBm

5. The set parameters are translated into the following RAK4600 AT command that is sent to both units as shown in Figure 60:

```
at+set_config=lorap2p:869525000:7:0:1:5:5
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/p2p-param-example.png"
  width="40%"
  caption="Setting both RAK4600 units with the LoRa P2P parameters"
/>

6. Next, set the transmission mode of the RAK4600. In this example, Unit 1 is set to sender mode, and Unit 2 is set to receiver mode by AT command.
  * **Unit 1** (Sender):		
```
at+set_config=lorap2p:transfer_mode:2
```
  * **Unit 2** (Receiver):	
```
at+set_config=lorap2p:transfer_mode:1
```

  width="80%"
  caption="Set the module in the sender (left) and the receiver (right) mode"
/>

7. Now, to send a message, the string ‚Äú**123456890**‚Äù from Unit1 to Unit2. Type the command on Unit 1:

```
at+send=lorap2p:1234567890
```
* The message will be automatically received by Unit 2.

### Bluetooth Interface

Starting with the firmware version V3.0.0.6, there are three BLE modes in RAK4600 module: **Peripheral mode**, **Central mode**, and **Beacon scan mode**. 

1. **Peripheral mode**: In this mode, you can scan RAK4600 BLE and connect with it using your normal mobile devices.
2. **Central mode**: The RAK4600 BLE will not broadcast so that your normal mobile devices will not able to scan it. But it is useful for IoT use case, for example, you can connect some BLE sensor node to the RAK4600. By setting the RAK4600 in the central mode, the RAK4600 acts as a BLE gateway. In the central mode, "Nordic UART Service" is supported.
3. **Beacon scan mode**: The RAK4600 will scan the surrounding BLE signal. This mode is useful to scan for beacons like iBeacon near you.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
For the central and beacon scan patterns, you need to use the API development of RUI to play its role. Refer to the following link for BLE related API interfaces: [RUI API Reference](/RUI/)
:::

By default, RAK4600 BLE will work in the peripheral mode so that you can configure it over BLE including DFU easily. Note that every time after resetting, you have only 60 seconds to connect your mobile device with RAK4600 over BLE. If you don‚Äôt connect with RAK4600 in 60 seconds after resetting it, the RAK4600 BLE radio will not broadcast to reduce power consumption. There is no limitation once your mobile device has connected with RAK4600 over BLE in 60 seconds.

Surely, you can set RAK4600 BLE to work in the central mode. After a RAK4600 module reset, there will be 30 seconds that RAK4600 BLE radio works in the peripheral mode. In peripheral mode, you can connect to RAK4600 through BLE using your mobile device and configure RAK4600 over BLE. But if you don‚Äôt connect with RAK4600 through BLE in 30 seconds, the RAK4600 BLE radio will change to central mode automatically. In central mode, RAK4600 can not be scanned by your mobile devices until you change the work mode to the peripheral or reset RAK4600 again.


## Miscellaneous

### Upgrading the Firmware

Before to start working with the RAK4600, it is recommended to keep the RAK4600 updated to the latest version of the firmware. The latest firmware can be found in the software section of the [RAK4600 Module Datasheet](../../../../../Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK4600-Module/Datasheet/#firmware).

In the following sections, two (2) options for flashing new firmware in a RAK4600 are shown: **Upgrade through DAPLink** and **Upgrade through BLE**.

#### Firmware Upgrade Through DAPLink

Refer to [RAKDAP1 Flash and Debug Tool Overview](../../../../../Product-Categories/Accessories/RAKDAP1-Flash-and-Debug-Tool/Overview)

<!--
Refer to the [RAKDAP1 Flash and Debug Tool](/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAKDAP1-Flash-and-Debug-Tool/) guide in the Knowledge Hub.
To flash a new firmware we use RAKDAP1 tool a SWD adapter. It requires the Python3 tool pyocd on your computer.

##### Installing Environment

1.  Install Python3   

Because **pyocd** needs the **Python environment**, we must install **Python3**. We can download the Python3 package from Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install it using the default configuration. After installing successfully, we can check the version as follow:    

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/py_ver_check.png"
  width="40%"
  caption="Check Python version"
/> 

:::tip üìù NOTE:
If the Python version is above 3.4, pip3 is automatically installed. But if not, we should install pip3 manually.     
:::

2. Install pyocd using pip

Use the following command to install pyocd:     

```
pip3 install pyocd   
```

* After installation, check the version of pyocd as follow:    

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/pyocd_ver_check.png"
  width="20%"
  caption="Check pyocd version"
/> 
   
3. Install the support package for the MCU

After installing pyocd successfully we need to install the support package for the MCU. The command format is:

```
pyocd pack --install <MCU model>
```

**Example**: The MCU model for this board is **nrf52832** so the correct command is:

```
pyocd pack --install nrf52
```

The support packages are MDK packages. You can see a complete list at [https://www.keil.com/dd2/Pack/](https://www.keil.com/dd2/Pack/).

##### Flash the firmware using DAPLink and RAKDAP1

1. Connect the board to RAKDAP1

Connect the 4 debug/programming SWD pins of the board to the RAKDAP1 adapter(| VCC | GND | SWIO | SWCLK |)

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/rak4600-swd.png"
  width="60%"
  caption="RAK4600 to SWD debug pins"
/> 

2. Flash the latest firmware

To flash the latest firmware version the command is:

```
pyocd flash -target nrf52 <path/to/file.bin>
```    

* Depending on the size of the file, the flashing can take several minutes. The success or failure of the flashing will be shown in the command line:
