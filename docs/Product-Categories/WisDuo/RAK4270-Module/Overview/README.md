## Product Description

The RAK4270 LoRa Module includes an **STM32L071 MCU** and an **SX1262** LoRa chip, which supports eight spreading factors (SF5 ~ SF12) and signal bandwidth that can be adjusted between 7.8&nbsp;kHz to 500&nbsp;kHz. It has an ultra-low power consumption of 1.08&nbsp;uA in Sleep Mode, but during the Transmit Mode, it can reach the maximum output power of 22&nbsp;dBm. As a receiver, it can achieve a sensitivity of -148&nbsp;dBm.

The module complies with Class A and C of LoRaWAN 1.0.2 specifications, and it also supports LoRa Point to Point (P2P) communications. The module is suitable for various applications that require long-range data acquisition and low power consumption, such as smart meters, supply chain and logistics tracking, agricultural sensors, and smart cities.

You can configure the mode and operation of the RAK4270 module using the [AT Commands](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK4270-Module/AT-Command-Manual/) via a UART interface. Also, it offers low power features which is very suitable for battery powered applications.
