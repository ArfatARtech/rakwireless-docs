  caption="RAK3172-SiP UART2 connection"
/>

1. Any serial communication tool can be used like the [RAK Serial Port Tool](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/en/LoRa/Tools).

2. Configure the serial communication tool by selecting the proper port detected by the computer and configure the link as follows: 

 * Baud Rate: **115200 baud**
 * Data Bits: **8 bits**
 * Stop Bits: **1 stop bit**
 * Parity: **NONE**

#### Configuring RAK3172-SiP

To enable the RAK3172-SiP as a LoRa P2P module or a LoRaWAN end-device, the module must be configured and parameters must be set by sending AT commands.

The first step is to connect the RAK3172-SiP to the USB-UART converter computer as described in the previous section. Using a serial communication tool, you can now send commands to the RAK3172-SiP. For example, sending `AT` will display `OK`. For the details of all supported AT commands, refer to [AT Commands for RAK3172-SiP](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK3172-SiP/AT-Command-Manual/).


### Connecting to The Things Network (TTN)

In this section, a quick tutorial guide will show how to connect the RAK3172-SiP to the TTN platform. 

:::tip üìù NOTE:

In this guide, you need to have a working gateway that is connected to TTN or you have to be within the coverage of a TTN community network.

/>

As shown in **Figure 2**, The Things Stack (TTN V3) is an open-source LoRaWAN Network Server suitable for global, geo-distributed public and private deployments, as well as for small local networks. The architecture follows the LoRaWAN Network Reference Model for standards compliancy and interoperability. This project is actively maintained by [The Things Industries](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/).

LoRaWAN is a protocol for low-power wide-area networks. It allows for large-scale Internet of Things deployments where low-powered devices efficiently communicate with Internet-connected applications over long-range wireless connections.

The RAK3172-SiP WisDuo can be part of this ecosystem as a device, and the objective of this section is to demonstrate how simple it is to send data to The Things Stack using the LoRaWAN protocol. To achieve this, the RAK3172-SiP WisDuo must be located inside the coverage of a LoRaWAN gateway connected to The Things Stack server.

#### Registration to TTN and Creating LoRaWAN Applications

1. The first step is to go to [The Things Network platform](https://console.cloud.thethings.network/) and select a cluster, as shown in **Figure 3**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-sip/quickstart/image_1.png"
  width="100%"

  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-sip/quickstart/image_10.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Device activation configuration"
/>

3. Then you need to put a unique **End device ID** and EUIs (**DevEUI** and **AppEUI**), as shown in **Figure 13**. Check if your module has a DevEUI on the sticker or QR that you can scan then use this as the device unique DevEUI.

Optionally, you can add a more descriptive **End device name** and **End device description** about your device.

4. After putting all the details, click **Network layer settings** to proceed to the next step.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

It is advisable to use a meaningful end-device ID, end-device name, and end-device description that will match your device purpose. The end-device ID `rak-device` is for illustration purposes only.

:::

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-sip/quickstart/image_11.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="OTAA device information"

  caption="OTAA AppKey generation and device registration"
/>

You should now be able to see the device on the TTN console after you fully register your device, as shown in **Figure 16**.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

The **AppEUI**, **DevEUI**, and **AppKey** are the parameters that you will need to activate your LoRaWAN end-device via OTAA. The **AppKey** is hidden by default for security reasons, but you can easily show it by clicking the show button. You can also copy the parameters quickly using the copy button.

The three OTAA parameters on the TTN device console are MSB by default. 

These parameters are always accessible on the device console page, as shown in **Figure 16**.

#### OTAA Configuration for TTN

The RAK3172-SiP supports a series of AT commands to configure its internal parameters and control the functionalities of the module. 

1. To set up the RAK3172-SiP to join the TTN using OTAA, start by connecting the RAK3172-SiP to your computer (see **Figure 1**) and open the RAK Serial Port Tool. Select the right COM port and set the baud rate to 115200.

It is recommended to start by testing the serial communication and verify that the current configuration is working by sending these two AT commands:

```
AT
```

```
ATE
```

`ATE` will echo the commands you input to the module, which is useful for tracking the commands and troubleshooting.

You will receive `OK` when you input the two commands. After setting `ATE`, you can now see all the commands you input together with the replies. Try again `AT` and you should see it on the terminal followed by `OK`, as shown in **Figure 17**.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

If haven't received an `OK` or any reply, you need to check if the wiring of your UART lines is correct and if the baud is correctly configured to 115200. Also, you can check if the device is powered correctly. If you are getting power from a USB port, ensure that you have a good USB cable.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-sip/quickstart/atstart.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="at+version command response"
/>


2. The next step is to configure the OTAA LoRaWAN parameters in RAK3172-SiP: 

- LoRa work mode: **LoRaWAN**
- LoRaWAN join mode: **OTAA**
- LoRaWAN class: **Class A**
- LoRaWAN region: **EU868** 

Set the work mode to LoRaWAN.

```
AT+NWM=1
```

Set the LoRaWAN activation to OTAA.

```
AT+NJM=1
```

Set the LoRaWAN class to Class A.

```
AT+CLASS=A
```

Set the frequency/region to EU868.

```
AT+BAND=4
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:

Depending on the regional band you selected, you might need to configure the sub-band of your RAK3172-SiP to match the gateway and LoRaWAN network server. This is especially important for Regional Bands like US915 and AU915.

To configure the masking of channels for the sub-bands, you can use the `AT+MASK` command on the [AT Commands Manual](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK3172-SiP/AT-Command-Manual/#at-mask).

To illustrate, you can use sub-band 2 by sending the command `AT+MASK=0002`.
:::

**List of band parameter options**

| Code     | Regional Band |
| -------- | ------------- |
| 0        | EU433 (Not Supported) |

3. After the configuration of the LoRaWAN parameters, the next step is to set up the EUIs and key. You need the use the values from the TTN console.

- Device EUI: **1133557799224466**
- Application EUI: **1000000000000009**
- Application Key: **04FA4E626EF5CF227C969601176275C2**


Set the Device EUI.

```
AT+DEVEUI=1133557799224466
```

Set the Application EUI.

```
AT+APPEUI=1000000000000009
```

Set the Application Key.

```
AT+APPKEY=04FA4E626EF5CF227C969601176275C2
```

  width="90%"
  caption="Configuring LoRa parameters"
/>

4. After EUI and keys configuration, the device can now join the network and send payloads.

```
AT+JOIN=1:0:10:8
```

Join command format: **`AT+JOIN=w:x:y:z`**

| Parameter | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| w         | Join command - 1: joining, 0: stop joining.                  |
| x         | Auto-join config - 1: auto-join on power-up, 0: no auto-join |
| y         | Reattempt interval in seconds (7-255) - 8 is the default.        |
| z         | Number of join attempts (0-255) - 0 is default.              |

After 5 or 6 seconds, if the request is successfully received by a LoRa gateway, you should see a `+EVT:JOINED` status reply, as shown in **Figure 20**.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

If the OTAA device failed to join, you need to check if your device is within reach of a working LoRaWAN gateway that is configured to connect to TTN. It is also important to check that all your OTAA parameters (DEVEUI, APPEUI, and APPKEY) are correct using the `AT+DEVEUI=?`, `AT+APPEUI=?`, and `AT+APPKEY=?` commands. Lastly, ensure that the antenna of your device is properly connected.

After checking all the things above, try to join again. 
:::

5. With the end-device properly activated, you can now try to send some payload after a successful join.

```
AT+SEND=2:12345678
```

6. Send command format: **`AT+SEND=<port>:<payload>`**

4. After the configuration of the LoRaWAN parameters, the next step is to set up the device address and sessions keys. You need the use the values from the TTN console. 

- Device Address: **260BDE80**
- Application Session Key: **A585903A949C2B2D44B55E99E94CB533**
- Network Session Key: **433C7A924F7F6947778FE821525F183A**

Set the Device Address.

```
AT+DEVADDR=260BDE80
```

Set the Application Session Key.

```
AT+APPSKEY=A585903A949C2B2D44B55E99E94CB533
```

Set the Network Session Key.

```
AT+NWKSKEY=433C7A924F7F6947778FE821525F183A
```

5. After EUI and keys configuration, the device can now join the network and send some payload.

```
AT+JOIN=1:0:8:0
```

Join command format: **`AT+JOIN=w:x:y:z`**


| Parameter | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| w         | Join command - 1: joining, 0: stop joining.                  |
| x         | Auto-join config - 1: auto-join on power-up, 0: no auto-join |
| y         | Reattempt interval in seconds (7-255) - 8 is the default.    |
| z         | Number of join attempts (0-255) - 0 is default.              |


6. With the end-device properly activated, you can now try to send some payload after a successful join.

```
AT+SEND=3:12341234
```

Send command format: **`AT+SEND=<port>:<payload>`**

:::tip üìù NOTE:

If your LoRaWAN payload didn't reach the TTN, check if your device is within reach of a working LoRaWAN gateway that is configured to connect to TTN. It is also important to check that all your ABP parameters (DEVADDR, APPSKEY, and NWKSKEY) are correct by using `AT+DEVADDR=?`, `AT+APPSKEY=?`, and `AT+NWKSKEY=?` commands. Lastly, ensure that the antenna of your device is properly connected.

After checking all the things above, try to send LoRaWAN payloads again.

  width="60%"
  caption="RAK3172-SiP in the context of the ChirpStack platform"
/>

The ChirpStack, previously known as the LoRaServer project, provides open-source components for building LoRaWAN networks. Like in the case of TTN, the RAK3172-SiP is located in the periphery and will transmit the data to the backend servers through a LoRa gateway. Learn more about [ChirpStack](https://www.chirpstack.io/).

:::tip üìù NOTE:

It is assumed that you are using a RAK Gateway and its built-in ChirpStack. Also, the gateway with the ChirpStack must be configured successfully. For further information, check the RAK documents for more details.

:::

* In summary, these are the requirements: 

  1. In a ChirpStack online gateway, the frequency band of the nodes should be consistent with the frequency band of the gateway in use.
      * [Connect the Gateway with Chirpstack](/Product-Categories/WisGate/RAK7243/Quickstart/#connect-the-gateway-with-chirpstack)
  2. RAK Serial Port Tool provided by RAK
  3. RAK3172-SiP module

:::tip üìù NOTE:
The frequency band used in the demonstration is EU868.

7. Once the node is created, fill in the necessary data. You can generate a Device EUI automatically by clicking the following icon, or you can write a correct Device EUI in the edit box.

Fill in the parameters requested:

* **Device name and Device description**: These are descriptive texts about your device. 

* **Device EUI**: This interface allows you to generate a Device EUI automatically by clicking the generate icon. You can also add a specific Device EUI directly in the form. 

* **Device Profile**: 
  * If you want to join in OTAA mode, select ‚Äú**DeviceProfile_OTAA**‚Äù.
  * If you want to join in ABP mode, select ‚Äú**DeviceProfile_ABP**‚Äù.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
Device profiles **DeviceProfile_OTAA** and **DeviceProfile_ABP** are only available if you are using the built-in Chirpstack LoRaWAN Server of RAK Gateways.

If you have your own Chirpstack installation, you can set up the device profile with `LoRaWAN MAC version 1.0.3` and `LoRaWAN Regional Parameters revision B` to make it compatible with RAK3172-SiP.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

Standard OTAA mode requires the **Device EUI**, **Application Key**, and **Application EUI**, but in ChirpStack‚Äôs implementation, only the Device EUI and the Application Key are mandatory. The Application EUI is not required and not recorded in the Application tab. Nevertheless, you can reuse the Device EUI as the Application EUI during the configuration on the side of the node. 

:::

#### OTAA Configuration for Chirpstack

The RAK3172-SiP supports a series of AT commands to configure its internal parameters and control the functionalities of the module. 

1. To set up the RAK3172-SiP to join the Chirpstack using OTAA, start by connecting the RAK3172-SiP to the Computer (see **Figure 1**) and open the RAK Serial Port Tool. Select the right COM port and set the baud rate to 115200.

It is recommended to start by testing the serial communication and verify that the current configuration is working by sending these two AT commands:

```
AT
```

```
ATE
```

`ATE` will echo the commands you input to the module, which is useful for tracking the commands and troubleshooting.

You will receive `OK` when you input the two commands. After setting `ATE`, you can now see all the commands you input together with the replies. Try again `AT` and you should see it on the terminal followed by `OK`, as shown in **Figure 47**.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

If haven't received an `OK` or any reply, you need to check if the wiring of your UART lines is correct and if the baud is correctly configured to 115200. Also, you can check if the device is powered correctly. If you are getting power from a USB port, ensure that you have a good USB cable.
:::

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-sip/quickstart/atstart.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="at+version command response"
/>


2. The next step is to configure the OTAA LoRaWAN parameters in RAK3172-SiP: 

- LoRa work mode: **LoRaWAN**
- LoRaWAN join mode: **OTAA**
- LoRaWAN class: **Class A**
- LoRaWAN region: **EU868** 

Set the work mode to LoRaWAN.

```
AT+NWM=1
```

Set the LoRaWAN activation to OTAA.

```
AT+NJM=1
```

Set the LoRaWAN class to Class A.

```
AT+CLASS=A
```

Set the frequency/region to EU868.

```
AT+BAND=4
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:

Depending on the regional band you selected, you might need to configure the sub-band of your RAK3172-SiP to match the gateway and LoRaWAN network server. This is especially important for Regional Bands like US915 and AU915.

To configure the masking of channels for the sub-bands, you can use the `AT+MASK` command that can be found on the [AT Command Manual](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK3172-SiP/AT-Command-Manual/#at-mask).

To illustrate, you can use sub-band 2 by sending the command `AT+MASK=0002`.
:::

**List of band parameter options**

| Code     | Regional Band |
| -------- | ------------- |
| 0        | EU433 (Not Supported) |
| 1        | CN470 (Not Supported) |
| 2        | RU864         |

3. After the configuration of the LoRaWAN parameters, the next step is to set up the DevEUI and AppKey. You need the use the values from the Chirpstack device console. 

:::tip üìù NOTE:
The Application EUI parameter is not required in the ChirpStack platform; therefore, it is possible to use the same id as the Device EUI. 
::: 

- Device EUI: **5E9D1E0857CF25F1**
- Application EUI: **5E9D1E0857CF25F1**
- Application Key: **F921D50CD7D02EE3C5E6142154F274B2**


Set the Device EUI.

```
AT+DEVEUI=5E9D1E0857CF25F1
```

Set the Application EUI.

```
AT+APPEUI=5E9D1E0857CF25F1
```

Set the Application Key.

```
AT+APPKEY=F921D50CD7D02EE3C5E6142154F274B2
```

4. After EUI and key configuration, the device can now join the network and send some payload.

```
AT+JOIN=1:0:10:8
```

Join command format: **`AT+JOIN=w:x:y:z`**

| Parameter | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| w         | Join command - 1: joining, 0: stop joining.                  |
| x         | Auto-join config - 1: auto-join on power-up, 0: no auto-join |
| y         | Reattempt interval in seconds (7-255) - 8 is the default.    |
| z         | Number of join attempts (0-255) - 0 is default.              |

After 5 or 6 seconds, if the request is successfully received by a LoRa gateway, you should see the JOINED status reply.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

If the OTAA device failed to join, you need to check if your device is within reach of a working LoRaWAN gateway that is configured to connect to Chirpstack. It is also important to check that all your OTAA parameters (DEVEUI and APPKEY) are correct, using the `AT+DEVEUI=?` and `AT+APPKEY=?` commands. Lastly, ensure that the antenna of your device is properly connected.

After checking all the things above, try to join again.
:::

5. With the end-device properly activated, you can now try to send some payload after a successful join.

```
AT+SEND=2:12345678
```

Send command format: **`AT+SEND=<port>:<payload>`**

  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-sip/quickstart/chirp_otaa_send.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="OTAA test sample data sent via RAK Serial Port Tool"
/>

On the ChirpStack platform, you should see the join and uplink messages in the LORAWAN FRAMES tab, as shown in **Figure 51**. By convention, messages sent from nodes to gateways are considered as **Uplinks** while messages sent by gateways to nodes are considered as **Downlinks**.

#### Chirpstack ABP Device Registration

1. During the registration of a new device, if you select ‚Äú**DeviceProfile_ABP**‚Äù, as shown in Figure 52, then the ChirpStack platform will assume that this device will join the LoRaWAN network using the ABP mode. 


:::tip üìù NOTE:

Check ‚Äú**Disable counting frame verification**‚Äù. During the test, when the module is restarted, the frame counting number will be also be restarted from zero. This would cause a synchronization problem with the ChirpStack server treating it as a replay attack. For the testing purpose, it is safe to disable this feature, but remember to activate it in a production environment.

2. After selecting the ABP mode, the following parameters appear in the Activation tab: 

Then, you can see that there are some parameters for ABP in the **‚ÄúACTIVATION‚Äù** item:

  * **Device Address**
  * **Network Session Key**
  * **Application Session Key**

### LoRa P2P Mode

This section will show you how to set up and connect two RAK3172-SiP units to work in the LoRa P2P mode. The configuration of the RAK3172-SiP units is done by connecting the two modules to a general-purpose computer using a USB-UART converter. The setup of each RAK3172-SiP can be done separately, but testing the LoRa P2P mode will require having both units connected simultaneously. This could be done by having one computer with two USB ports or two computers with one USB port each.

It is recommended to start by testing the serial communication and verify the current configuration is working by sending the basic `AT` command.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-sip/quickstart/p2p_at.png"
  width="60%"
  caption="AT Command Test"
/>


1. To set up the RAK3172-SiP to work in LoRa P2P mode, you need to input the work mode command on both RAK3172-SiP.

```
AT+NWM=0
```

For this P2P setup, the LoRa parameters are the following:

- Link frequency: **868000000&nbsp;Hz**
- Spreading factor: **7**
- Bandwidth: **125&nbsp;kHz**
- Coding Rate: 0 = **4/5**
- Preamble Length: **10**
- Power: **14&nbsp;dBm**

2. Input the P2P setup on both RAK3172-SiP. The parameters should be exactly the same on the two modules. 

```
AT+P2P=868000000:7:125:0:10:14
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:

Refer to the [P2P Mode](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK3172-SiP/AT-Command-Manual/) section of the AT command documentation to learn more about the definition of the parameters used.

3. To set one module as a receiver (RX), you need to set the value of the P2P receive command to 65535.

```
AT+PRECV=65535 
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:

- If the `AT+PRECV` value is set to 65534, the device will continuously listen to P2P LoRa TX packets without any timeout. This is the same as setting the device in RX mode.
- If the `AT+PRECV` value is set to 65535, the device will listen to P2P TX without a timeout. But it will stop listening once a P2P LoRa packet is received to save power.
- If the `AT+PRECV` value is 0, the device will stop listening to P2P TX data. The device is in TX mode.

:::

With one module configured as RX, the other device will be the TX.

4. You can now try to send a P2P payload.

```
AT+PSEND=11223344
```
