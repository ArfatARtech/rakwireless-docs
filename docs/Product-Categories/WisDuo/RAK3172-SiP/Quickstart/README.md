## Product Configuration

### RAK3172-SiP as a Stand-Alone Device Using RUI3

#### Hardware Setup

The RAK3172-SiP requires a few hardware connections before you can make it work. The bare minimum requirement is to have the power section properly configured, reset button, antenna, and USB connection. 

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
Firmware update is done via UART2 pins. If you connect the module to an external device that will be interfacing with UART2, take extra precautions in your board design to ensure you can still perform FW update to it. There should be a way in your board design that can disconnect the external device to RAK3172-SiP UART2 before connecting the module to the PC (via USB-UART converter) for the FW update process.

An alternative option to update firmware aside from UART2 is to use SWD pins (SWCLK & SWDIO). This method will require you to use external tools like ST-LINK or RAKDAP1.

:::

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
When using the LoRa transceiver, make sure that an antenna is always connected. Using this transceiver without an antenna can damage the module.
:::

#### Software Setup

The default firmware of the RAK3172-SiP module is based on RUI3, which allows you to develop your custom firmware to connect sensors and other peripherals to it. To develop your custom firmware using Arduino IDE, first, you need to add **RAKwireless RUI STM32 Boards** in the Arduino board manager, which will be discussed in this guide. You can then use RUI3 APIs for your intended application and upload also the custom firmware via UART. The AT commands of the RAK3172-SiP module is still available even if you compile custom firmware via RUI3. You can send AT commands via UART2 connection.

##### RAK3172-SiP RUI3 Board Support Package in Arduino IDE

If you don't have an Arduino IDE yet, you can download it on the [Arduino official website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and follow the installation procedure in the [miscellaneous section](/Product-Categories/wisduo/RAK3172-SiP/Quickstart/#miscellaneous) of this document.

### RAK3172-SiP as a LoRa/LoRaWAN Modem via AT Command

#### AT Command via UART2

RAK3172-SiP module can be configured using AT commands via the UART2 interface. You need a USB to UART TTL adapter to connect the RAK3172-SiP to your computer's USB port and a serial terminal tool. You can use the [RAK Serial Port Tool](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/en/LoRa/Tools) so you can easily send AT commands and view the replies from the console output. The RAK Serial Port Tool commands still uses the RUI V2 AT commands by default. You can modify it to have RUI3 AT commands and then save it.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
Firmware update and AT command functionality is done via UART2 pins. If you will connect the module to an external host MCU that will send AT commands via UART2, take extra precautions in your board design to ensure you can still perform FW update to it. There should be a way in your board design that can disconnect the host MCU UART to connect to RAK3172 UART2 before connecting the module to the PC (via USB-UART converter) for the FW update process.

An alternative option to update firmware aside from UART2 is to use SWD pins (SWCLK & SWDIO). This method will require you to use external tools like ST-LINK or RAKDAP1.
:::

##### Connect to the RAK3172-SiP 

1. Connect the RAK3172-SiP to the serial port of a general-purpose computer (USB port) using a USB to UART TTL adapter like [RAKDAP1](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/accessories/products/daplink-tool), as shown in **Figure 21**.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

There are other connections needed on the RAK3172-SiP aside from the VDD, GND, and UART2 pins. Check the minimal needed external connections in [RAK3272-SiP Breakout Board Schematic](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK3272-SiP-Breakout-Board/Datasheet/#hardware).

##### Connecting to The Things Network (TTN)

In this section, a quick tutorial guide will show how to connect the RAK3172-SiP to the TTN platform. 

:::tip üìù NOTE:

In this guide, you need to have a working gateway that is connected to TTN or you have to be within the coverage of a TTN community network.

:::

<rk-img

  width="95%"
  caption="RAK3172-SiP EVB in the context of the TTN"
/>

As shown in **Figure 22**, The Things Stack (TTN V3) is an open-source LoRaWAN Network Server suitable for global, geo-distributed public and private deployments, as well as for small local networks. The architecture follows the LoRaWAN Network Reference Model for standards compliance and interoperability. This project is actively maintained by [The Things Industries](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/).

LoRaWAN is a protocol for low-power wide-area networks. It allows large-scale Internet of Things deployments where low-powered devices efficiently communicate with Internet-connected applications over long-range wireless connections.

The RAK3172-SiP WisDuo can be part of this ecosystem as a device, and the objective of this section is to demonstrate how simple it is to send data to The Things Stack using the LoRaWAN protocol. To achieve this, the RAK3172-SiP WisDuo must be located inside the coverage of a LoRaWAN gateway connected to The Things Stack server.

##### Registration to TTN and Creating LoRaWAN Applications

1. The first step is to go to [The Things Network platform](https://console.cloud.thethings.network/) and select a cluster, as shown in **Figure 23**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-sip/quickstart/image_1.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Selecting cluster in TTN V3"
/>

You can use the same login credentials on the TTN V2 if you have one. If you have no account yet, you need to create one.

2. To register as a new user to TTN, click on **Login with The Things ID** and then select **register** on the next page, as shown in **Figure 24** and **Figure 25**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-sip/quickstart/image_2.png"
  width="100%"

/>

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-sip/quickstart/image_3.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Registration of new account"
/>

3. You should now be on the step of creating your TTN account. Fill in all the necessary details and activate your account.

4. After creating an account, you should log in on the platform using your username/email and password then click **Submit**, as shown in **Figure 26**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-sip/quickstart/image_4.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Logging in to TTN platform"
/>

5. Click **Authorize** to proceed.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-sip/quickstart/image_5.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Authorization to TTN"
/>

6. Now that you are logged in to the platform, the next step is to create an application. Click **Create an application**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-sip/quickstart/image_6.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Creating TTN application for your LoRaWAN devices"
/>

7. To have an application registered, you need to input first the specific details and necessary information about your application then click **Create application**.
 
<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-sip/quickstart/image_7.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Details of the TTN application"
/>

8. If you had no error during the previous step, you should now be on the application console page. The next step is to add end-devices to your TTN application. LoRaWAN specification enforces that each end-device has to be personalized and activated. There are two options for registering devices depending on the activation mode you select. Activation can be done either via Over-The-Air-Activation (OTAA) or Activation-By-Personalization (ABP).

##### TTN OTAA Device Registration

1. Go to your application console to be able to register a device. To start adding an OTAA end-device, click **+ Add end device**, as shown in **Figure 30**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-sip/quickstart/image_8.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Add end device"
/>

2. To register the module, click first **Manually** then configure the activation method by selecting **Over the air activation (OTAA)** and compatible **LoRaWAN version** then click the **Start** button, as shown in **Figure 31** and **Figure 32**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-sip/quickstart/image_9.png"

/>

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-sip/quickstart/image_10.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Device activation configuration"
/>

3. Then you need to put a unique **End device ID** and EUIs (**DevEUI** and **AppEUI**), as shown in **Figure 33**. Check if your module has a DevEUI on the sticker or QR that you can scan then use this as the device unique DevEUI.

Optionally, you can add a more descriptive **End device name** and **End device description** about your device.

4. After putting all the details, click **Network layer settings** to proceed to the next step.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

It is advisable to use a meaningful end-device ID, end-device name, and end-device description that will match your device purpose. The end-device ID `rak-device` is for illustration purposes only.

:::

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-sip/quickstart/image_11.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="OTAA device information"
/>

5. The next step is to set up the **Frequency plan**, a compatible **Regional Parameter version**, and the **LoRaWAN class** supported. Then you can click **Join settings**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-sip/quickstart/image_12.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="OTAA configuration"
/>

6. The last step in the registration of a new OTAA end-device is the configuration of the **AppKey**. To get the AppKey, you must click the **generate button**. Then click **Add end device** to finish your new device registration.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-sip/quickstart/image_13.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="OTAA AppKey generation and device registration"
/>

You should now be able to see the device on the TTN console after you fully register your device, as shown in **Figure 36**.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

The **AppEUI**, **DevEUI**, and **AppKey** are the parameters that you will need to activate your LoRaWAN end-device via OTAA. The **AppKey** is hidden by default for security reasons, but you can easily show it by clicking the show button. You can also copy the parameters quickly using the copy button.

The three OTAA parameters on the TTN device console are MSB by default. 

These parameters are always accessible on the device console page, as shown in **Figure 36**.

##### OTAA Configuration for TTN

The RAK3172-SiP supports a series of AT commands to configure its internal parameters and control the functionalities of the module. 

1. To set up the RAK3172-SiP to join the TTN using OTAA, start by connecting the RAK3172-SiP to your computer (see **[Figure 21](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK3172-SiP/Quickstart/#connect-to-the-rak3172-sip)**) and open the RAK Serial Port Tool. Select the right COM port and set the baud rate to 115200.

It is recommended to start by testing the serial communication and verify that the current configuration is working by sending these two AT commands:

```
AT
```

```
ATE
```

`ATE` will echo the commands you input to the module, which is useful for tracking the commands and troubleshooting.

You will receive `OK` when you input the two commands. After setting `ATE`, you can now see all the commands you input together with the replies. Try again `AT` and you should see it on the terminal followed by `OK`, as shown in **Figure 37**.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

If haven't received an `OK` or any reply, you need to check if the wiring of your UART lines is correct and if the baud is correctly configured to 115200. Also, you can check if the device is powered correctly. If you are getting power from a USB port, ensure that you have a good USB cable.
:::

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-sip/quickstart/atstart.png"

2. The next step is to configure the OTAA LoRaWAN parameters in RAK3172-SiP: 

- LoRa work mode: **LoRaWAN**
- LoRaWAN join mode: **OTAA**
- LoRaWAN class: **Class A**
- LoRaWAN region: **EU868** 

Set the work mode to LoRaWAN.

```

:::tip üìù NOTE:

Depending on the regional band you selected, you might need to configure the sub-band of your RAK3172-SiP to match the gateway and LoRaWAN network server. This is especially important for Regional Bands like US915 and AU915.

To configure the masking of channels for the sub-bands, you can use the `AT+MASK` command on the [AT Commands Manual](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK3172-SiP/AT-Command-Manual/#at-mask).

To illustrate, you can use sub-band 2 by sending the command `AT+MASK=0002`.

4. After EUI and keys configuration, the device can now join the network and send payloads.

```
AT+JOIN=1:0:10:8
```

Join command format: **`AT+JOIN=w:x:y:z`**

| Parameter | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| w         | Join command - 1: joining, 0: stop joining.                  |
| x         | Auto-join config - 1: auto-join on power-up, 0: no auto-join |
| y         | Reattempt interval in seconds (7-255) - 8 is the default.        |
| z         | Number of join attempts (0-255) - 0 is default.              |

After 5 or 6 seconds, if the request is successfully received by a LoRaWAN gateway, you should see a `+EVT:JOINED` status reply, as shown in **Figure 40**.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

If the OTAA device failed to join, you need to check if your device is within reach of a working LoRaWAN gateway that is configured to connect to TTN. It is also important to check that all your OTAA parameters (DEVEUI, APPEUI, and APPKEY) are correct using the `AT+DEVEUI=?`, `AT+APPEUI=?`, and `AT+APPKEY=?` commands. Lastly, ensure that the antenna of your device is properly connected.

After checking all the things above, try to join again. 
:::

5. With the end-device properly activated, you can now try to send some payload after a successful join.

```

##### ABP Configuration for TTN

1. To set up the RAK3172-SiP to join the TTN using ABP, start by connecting the RAK3172-SiP to the computer (see **[Figure 21](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK3172-SiP/Quickstart/#connect-to-the-rak3172-sip)**) and open the RAK Serial Port Tool. Select the right COM port and set the baud rate to 115200.

It is recommended to start by testing the serial communication and verify the current configuration is working by sending these two AT commands:

```
AT
```

```
ATE
```

`ATE` will echo the commands you input to the module, which is useful for tracking the commands and troubleshooting.

2. You will receive OK when you input the two commands. After setting `ATE`, you can now see all the commands you input together with the replies. Try again `AT` and you should see it on the terminal followed by OK, as shown in **Figure 49**.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

If haven't received an `OK` or any reply, you need to check if the wiring of your UART lines is correct and if the baud is correctly configured to 115200. Also, you can check if the device is powered correctly. If you are getting power from a USB port, ensure that you have a good USB cable.

  width="60%"
  caption="RAK3172-SiP in the context of the ChirpStack platform"
/>

The ChirpStack, previously known as the LoRaServer project, provides open-source components for building LoRaWAN networks. Like in the case of TTN, the RAK3172-SiP is located in the periphery and will transmit the data to the backend servers through a LoRaWAN gateway. Learn more about [ChirpStack](https://www.chirpstack.io/).

:::tip üìù NOTE:

It is assumed that you are using a RAK Gateway and its built-in ChirpStack. Also, the gateway with the ChirpStack must be configured successfully. For further information, check the RAK documents for more details.

:::

* In summary, these are the requirements: 

  1. In a ChirpStack online gateway, the frequency band of the nodes should be consistent with the frequency band of the gateway in use.
      * [Connect the Gateway with Chirpstack](/Product-Categories/WisGate/RAK7243/Quickstart/#connect-the-gateway-with-chirpstack)
  2. RAK Serial Port Tool provided by RAK
  3. RAK3172-SiP module

:::tip üìù NOTE:
The frequency band used in the demonstration is EU868.

##### OTAA Configuration for Chirpstack

The RAK3172-SiP supports a series of AT commands to configure its internal parameters and control the functionalities of the module. 

1. To set up the RAK3172-SiP to join the Chirpstack using OTAA, start by connecting the RAK3172-SiP to the Computer (see **[Figure 21](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK3172-SiP/Quickstart/#connect-to-the-rak3172-sip)**) and open the RAK Serial Port Tool. Select the right COM port and set the baud rate to 115200.

It is recommended to start by testing the serial communication and verify that the current configuration is working by sending these two AT commands:

```
AT
```

```
ATE
```

`ATE` will echo the commands you input to the module, which is useful for tracking the commands and troubleshooting.

You will receive `OK` when you input the two commands. After setting `ATE`, you can now see all the commands you input together with the replies. Try again `AT` and you should see it on the terminal followed by `OK`, as shown in **Figure 67**.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

If haven't received an `OK` or any reply, you need to check if the wiring of your UART lines is correct and if the baud is correctly configured to 115200. Also, you can check if the device is powered correctly. If you are getting power from a USB port, ensure that you have a good USB cable.

2. The next step is to configure the OTAA LoRaWAN parameters in RAK3172-SiP: 

- LoRa work mode: **LoRaWAN**
- LoRaWAN join mode: **OTAA**
- LoRaWAN class: **Class A**
- LoRaWAN region: **EU868** 

Set the work mode to LoRaWAN.

```
AT+NWM=1
```

Set the LoRaWAN activation to OTAA.

```
AT+NJM=1
```

Set the LoRaWAN class to Class A.

```
AT+CLASS=A
```

Set the frequency/region to EU868.

```
AT+BAND=4
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:

Depending on the regional band you selected, you might need to configure the sub-band of your RAK3172-SiP to match the gateway and LoRaWAN network server. This is especially important for Regional Bands like US915 and AU915.

To configure the masking of channels for the sub-bands, you can use the `AT+MASK` command that can be found on the [AT Command Manual](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK3172-SiP/AT-Command-Manual/#at-mask).

To illustrate, you can use sub-band 2 by sending the command `AT+MASK=0002`.

AT+JOIN=1:0:10:8
```

Join command format: **`AT+JOIN=w:x:y:z`**

| Parameter | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| w         | Join command - 1: joining, 0: stop joining.                  |
| x         | Auto-join config - 1: auto-join on power-up, 0: no auto-join |
| y         | Reattempt interval in seconds (7-255) - 8 is the default.    |
| z         | Number of join attempts (0-255) - 0 is default.              |

After 5 or 6 seconds, if the request is successfully received by a LoRaWAN gateway, you should see the JOINED status reply.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

If the OTAA device failed to join, you need to check if your device is within reach of a working LoRaWAN gateway that is configured to connect to Chirpstack. It is also important to check that all your OTAA parameters (DEVEUI and APPKEY) are correct, using the `AT+DEVEUI=?` and `AT+APPKEY=?` commands. Lastly, ensure that the antenna of your device is properly connected.

After checking all the things above, try to join again.
:::

5. With the end-device properly activated, you can now try to send some payload after a successful join.

```
AT+SEND=2:12345678
```

Send command format: **`AT+SEND=<port>:<payload>`**

  caption="OTAA test sample data sent via RAK Serial Port Tool"
/>

On the ChirpStack platform, you should see the join and uplink messages in the LORAWAN FRAMES tab, as shown in **Figure 71**. By convention, messages sent from nodes to gateways are considered as **Uplinks** while messages sent by gateways to nodes are considered as **Downlinks**.

##### Chirpstack ABP Device Registration

1. During the registration of a new device, if you select ‚Äú**DeviceProfile_ABP**‚Äù, as shown in **Figure 72**, then the ChirpStack platform will assume that this device will join the LoRaWAN network using the ABP mode. 


:::tip üìù NOTE:

Check ‚Äú**Disable counting frame verification**‚Äù. During the test, when the module is restarted, the frame counting number will be also be restarted from zero. This would cause a synchronization problem with the ChirpStack server treating it as a replay attack. For the testing purpose, it is safe to disable this feature, but remember to activate it in a production environment.

  width="100%"
  caption="ChirpStack console, Configuring a device"
/>

2. After selecting the ABP mode, the following parameters appear in the Activation tab: 

Then, you can see that there are some parameters for ABP in the **‚ÄúACTIVATION‚Äù** item:

  * **Device Address**
  * **Network Session Key**
  * **Application Session Key**

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-sip/quickstart/43.abp-activation-parameters.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Chirpstack ABP activation parameters needed"
/>

3. The parameters can be generated as random numbers by the platform or can be set with user values. Once these parameters are filled in properly, the process is completed by clicking on the ‚Äú**ACTIVATE DEVICE**‚Äù button.


##### ABP Configuration for Chirpstack

1. To set up the RAK3172-SiP to join the Chirpstack using ABP, start by connecting the RAK3172-SiP to the Computer (see **[Figure 21](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK3172-SiP/Quickstart/#connect-to-the-rak3172-sip)**) and open the RAK Serial Port Tool. Select the right COM port and set the baud rate to 115200.

It is recommended to start by testing the serial communication and verify that the current configuration is working by sending these two AT commands:

```
AT
```

```
ATE
```

`ATE` will echo the commands you input to the module, which is useful for tracking the commands and troubleshooting.

You will receive `OK` when you input the two commands. After setting `ATE`, you can now see all the commands you input together with the replies. Try again `AT` and you should see it on the terminal followed by `OK`, as shown in **Figure 74**.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

If haven't received an `OK` or any reply, you need to check if the wiring of your UART lines is correct and if the baud is correctly configured to 115200. Also, you can check if the device is powered correctly. If you are getting power from a USB port, ensure that you have a good USB cable.
:::

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-sip/quickstart/atstart.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="at+version command response"
/>


2. The next step is to configure the ABP LoRaWAN parameters in RAK3172-SiP: 

- LoRa work mode: **LoRaWAN**
- LoRaWAN join mode: **ABP**
- LoRaWAN class: **Class A**
- LoRaWAN region: **EU868** 

Set the work mode to LoRaWAN. It can be set to P2P as well but by default, the device is in LoRaWAN mode.

```
AT+NWM=1
```

Set the LoRaWAN activation to ABP.

```
AT+NJM=0
```

Set the LoRaWAN class to Class A.

```
AT+CLASS=A
```

Set the frequency/region to EU868.

```
AT+BAND=4
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:

Depending on the regional band you selected, you might need to configure the sub-band of your RAK3172-SiP to match the gateway and LoRaWAN network server. This is especially important on Regional Bands like US915 and AU915.

To configure the masking of channels for the sub-bands, you can use the `AT+MASK command` on the [AT Commands Manual](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK3172-SiP/AT-Command-Manual/#at-mask).

To illustrate, you can use sub-band 2 by sending the command `AT+MASK=0002`.
:::

**List of band parameter options**

| Code     | Regional Band |
| -------- | ------------- |
| 0        | EU433 (Not Supported) |
| 1        | CN470 (Not Supported) |
| 2        | RU864         |
| 3        | IN865         |
| 4        | EU868         |
| 5        | US915         |
| 6        | AU915         |
| 7        | KR920         |
| 8        | AS923         |

3. After the configuration of the LoRaWAN parameters, the next step is to set up the device address and session keys. You need the use the values from the TTN device console. 

- Device Address: **26011AF9**
- Application Session Key: **4D42EC5CAF97F03D833CDAf5003F69E1**
- Network Session Key: **C280CB8D1DF688BC18601A97025C5488**


Set the Device Address.

```
AT+DEVADDR=26011AF9
```

Set the Application Session Key.

```
AT+APPSKEY=4D42EC5CAF97F03D833CDAf5003F69E1
```

Set the Network Session Key.

```
AT+NWKSKEY=C280CB8D1DF688BC18601A97025C5488
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-sip/quickstart/chirp_abp_key.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="Configuring LoRa Parameters"
/>

After EUI and keys configuration, the device can now join the network and send some payload.

```
AT+JOIN=1:0:10:8
```

Join command format: **`AT+JOIN=w:x:y:z`**

| Parameter | Description                                                 |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| w         | Join command - 1: joining, 0: stop joining.                 |
| x         | Auto-join config - 1: auto-join on power-up, 0: no auto-join |
| y         | Reattempt interval in seconds (7-255) - 8 is the default.       |
| z         | Number of join attempts (0-255) - 0 is default.             |

4. After 5 or 6 seconds, if the request is successfully received by a LoRaWAN gateway, then you should see the JOINED status reply.

5. You can now try to send some payload after a successful join.

```
AT+SEND=2:12341234
```
Send command format: **`AT+SEND=<port>:<payload>`**

#### LoRa P2P Mode

This section will show you how to set up and connect two RAK3172-SiP units to work in the LoRa P2P mode. The configuration of the RAK3172-SiP units is done by connecting the two modules to a general-purpose computer using a USB-UART converter. The setup of each RAK3172-SiP can be done separately, but testing the LoRa P2P mode will require having both units connected simultaneously. This could be done by having one computer with two USB ports or two computers with one USB port each.

It is recommended to start by testing the serial communication and verify the current configuration is working by sending the basic `AT` command.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-sip/quickstart/p2p_at.png"
  width="60%"
  caption="AT Command Test"
/>


1. To set up the RAK3172-SiP to work in LoRa P2P mode, you need to input the work mode command on both RAK3172-SiP.

```
AT+NWM=0
```

For this P2P setup, the LoRa parameters are the following:

- Link frequency: **868000000&nbsp;Hz**
- Spreading factor: **7**
- Bandwidth: **125&nbsp;kHz**
- Coding Rate: 0 = **4/5**
- Preamble Length: **10**
- Power: **14&nbsp;dBm**

2. Input the P2P setup on both RAK3172-SiP. The parameters should be exactly the same on the two modules. 

```
AT+P2P=868000000:7:125:0:10:14
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:

Refer to the [P2P Mode](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK3172-SiP/AT-Command-Manual/) section of the AT command documentation to learn more about the definition of the parameters used.

  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-sip/quickstart/p2p_setup.png"
  width="60%"
  caption="Configuring P2P in both RAK3172-SiP module"
/>


3. To set one module as a receiver (RX), you need to set the value of the P2P receive command to 65535.

```
AT+PRECV=65535 
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:

- If the `AT+PRECV` value is set to 65534, the device will continuously listen to P2P LoRa TX packets without any timeout. This is the same as setting the device in RX mode.
- If the `AT+PRECV` value is set to 65535, the device will listen to P2P TX without a timeout. But it will stop listening once a P2P LoRa packet is received to save power.
- If the `AT+PRECV` value is 0, the device will stop listening to P2P TX data. The device is in TX mode.

:::

With one module configured as RX, the other device will be the TX.

4. You can now try to send a P2P payload.

```
AT+PSEND=11223344
```

### Arduino Installation

Go to the [Arduino official website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and download the Arduino IDE. You can see the multiple versions available for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. Choose the correct version of Arduino IDE and download it.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-sip/quickstart/1.download-arduino.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Arduino IDE latest version"
/>

#### For Windows

::: tip üìù NOTE   
**For Windows 10 users**:   
Do **NOT** install the Arduino IDE from the Microsoft App store. Install the original Arduino IDE from the Arduino official website instead, since the Arduino app from the Microsoft App Store has problems using third-party Board Support Packages.
:::

1. Install the Arduino IDE, which you just downloaded, on your Windows PC. 
2. Click **I Agree** then **Next** to proceed.

<rk-img

  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-sip/quickstart/5.installing.png"
  width="45%"
  caption="Ongoing installation"
/>


After 100% progress, the Arduino IDE has been installed successfully.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-sip/quickstart/6.installation-success.png"
  width="45%"
  caption="Successful installation"
/>

#### For Linux

First, you need the check the compatibility with your system and choose between the 32-bit, 64-bit, and ARM versions of the Arduino IDE for Linux.

##### Installing via a Tarball

After downloading the correct Arduino version, open a terminal, then run `ls` to check the installation file on the download folder.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-sip/quickstart/ls-arduino.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="Check the download folder"
/>


A tarball is a type of compressed folder, like a `.zip` file, commonly used to distribute software in Linux. To extract the files from the tarball, change the directory to where the downloaded tarball is, then run:

```
tar xvf arduino-version.xz
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-sip/quickstart/tar-linux.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="Tarball extract command"
/>

When the tar command finishes, run `ls` again. A folder named  **arduino-version** will be created.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-sip/quickstart/ls-tarball.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="Arduino install folder created"
/>

Change the current directory and go to the newly created folder directory. There will be a file named `install.sh` in the folder. Execute `sudo ./install.sh` to install the Arduino IDE.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-sip/quickstart/sudo-install.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="Arduino install script running"
/>

The `sudo` command temporarily elevates privileges allowing the installer to complete sensitive tasks without logging in as the root user.

#### For Mac OS X

In Mac OS X, the same as Linux, there is no installation process. It is just a process of decompression, then you can open Arduino IDE successfully.
