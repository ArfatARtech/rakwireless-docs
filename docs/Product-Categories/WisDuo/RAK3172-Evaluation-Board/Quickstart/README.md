## Product Configuration

### RAK3172-E as a Stand-Alone Device Using RUI3

#### Hardware Setup

The RAK3172-E requires a general-purpose computer USB port via a micro USB cable. You can use any serial communication tool, but it is recommended to use the [RAK Serial Port Tool](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/en/LoRa/Tools).

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
Firmware update is done via USB port. If you will connect the module to an external device that will be interfacing with USB, take extra precautions in your board design to ensure you can still perform FW update to it. There should be a way in your board design that can disconnect the external device to RAK3172-E USB before connecting the module to the PC via USB for the FW update process.

An alternative option to update firmware aside from USB is to use SWD pins (SWCLK & SWDIO). This method will require you to use external tools like ST-LINK or RAKDAP1.

/>

As shown in **Figure 22**, The Things Stack (TTN V3) is an open-source LoRaWAN Network Server suitable for global, geo-distributed public and private deployments as well as for small, local networks. The architecture follows the LoRaWAN Network Reference Model for standards compliancy and interoperability. This project is actively maintained by [The Things Industries](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/).

LoRaWAN is a protocol for low-power wide-area networks. It allows for large scale Internet of Things deployments where low-powered devices efficiently communicate with Internet-connected applications over long-range wireless connections.

The RAK3172 Evaluation Board can be part of this ecosystem as a device, and the objective of this section is to demonstrate how simple it is to send data to The Things Stack using the LoRaWAN protocol. To achieve this, the RAK3172 Evaluation Board must be located inside the coverage of a LoRaWAN gateway connected to The Things Stack server. 

##### Registration to TTN and Creating LoRaWAN Applications

1. The first step is to go to [The Things Network platform](https://console.cloud.thethings.network/) and select a cluster, as shown in **Figure 23**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-evaluation-board/quickstart/image_1.png"
  width="100%"

  width="100%"
  caption="Details of the TTN application"
/>

8. If you have no error on the previous step, you should now be on the application console page. The next step is to add end-devices to your TTN application.

LoRaWAN specifications enforce that each end-device has to be personalized and activated. There are two options in registering devices depending on the activation mode selected. Activation can be done either via Over-The-Air-Activation (OTAA) or Activation-By-Personalization (ABP).

##### TTN OTAA Device Registration

1. Go to your application console to register a device. To start adding an OTAA end-device, click **+ Add end device**, as shown in **Figure 30**.

<rk-img

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-evaluation-board/quickstart/image_10.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Device activation configuration"
/>

3. Then input a unique **End device ID** and EUIs (**DevEUI** and **AppEUI**), as shown in **Figure 33**. Check if your board has a DevEUI on sticker or QR that you can scan, then use this as the device unique DevEUI.

Optionally, you can add a more descriptive **End device name** and **End device description** about your device.

4. After putting all the details, click **Network layer settings** to proceed on the next step.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

It is advisable to use a meaningful End device ID, End device name, and End device description that will match your device purpose. The End device ID `rak-device` is for illustration purpose only.

:::

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-evaluation-board/quickstart/image_11.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="OTAA Device Information"

7. You should now be able to see the device on the TTN console after you fully register your device, as shown in **Figure 36**.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

- The **AppEUI**, **DevEUI**, and **AppKey** are the parameters that you will need to activate your LoRaWAN end-device via OTAA. The **AppKey** is hidden by default for security reasons, but you can easily show it by clicking the show button. You can also copy the parameters quickly using the copy button.

- The three OTAA parameters on the TTN device console are MSB by default. 

- These parameters are always accessible on the device console page, as shown in **Figure 36**.

##### OTAA Configuration for TTN

The RAK3172 Evaluation Board supports a series of AT commands to configure its internal parameters and control the functionalities of the board. 

1. To set up the RAK3172 Evaluation Board to join the TTN using OTAA, start by connecting the RAK3172 Evaluation Board to the Computer (see **Figure 21**) and open the RAK Serial Port Tool. Select the right COM port and set the baud rate to 115200.

It is recommended to start by testing the serial communication and verify that the current configuration is working by sending these two AT commands:

```
AT
```

```
ATE
```

`ATE` will echo the commands you input to the board, which is useful for tracking the commands and troubleshooting.

You will receive `OK` when you input the two commands. After setting `ATE`, you can now see all the commands you input together with the replies. Try again `AT` and you should see it on the terminal followed by `OK`, as shown in **Figure 37**.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

If you haven't received an `OK` or any reply, you need to check if the wiring of your UART lines is correct and if the baud is correctly configured to 115200. Also, you can check if the device is powered correctly. If you are getting power from a USB port, ensure that you have a good USB cable.
:::

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-evaluation-board/quickstart/atstart.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="at+version command response"
/>


2. The next step is to configure the OTAA LoRaWAN parameters in RAK3172-E: 

- LoRa work mode: **LoRaWAN**
- LoRaWAN join mode: **OTAA**
- LoRaWAN class: **Class A**
- LoRaWAN region: **EU868** 

Set the work mode to LoRaWAN.

```
AT+NWM=1
```

Set the LoRaWAN activation to OTAA.

```
AT+NJM=1
```

Set the LoRaWAN class to Class A.

```
AT+CLASS=A
```

Set the frequency/region to EU868.

```
AT+BAND=4
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:

Depending on the Regional Band you selected, you might need to configure the sub-band of your RAK3172-E to match the gateway and LoRaWAN network server. This is especially important on Regional Bands like US915, AU915, and CN470.

To configure the masking of channels for the sub-bands, you can use the [AT+MASK command](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK3172-Evaluation-Board/AT-Command-Manual/#at-mask) that can be found on the AT Commands Manual.

To illustrate, you can use use sub-band 2 by sending the command `AT+MASK=0002`.

##### ABP Configuration for TTN

1. To set up the RAK3172 Evaluation Board to join the TTN using ABP, start by connecting the RAK3172 Evaluation Board to the Computer (see **Figure 21**) and open the RAK Serial Port Tool. Select the right COM port and set the baud rate to 115200.

It is recommended to start by testing the serial communication and verify the current configuration is working by sending these two AT commands:

```
AT
```

```
ATE
```

ATE will echo the commands you input to the board, which is useful for tracking the commands and troubleshooting.

You will receive `OK` when you input the two commands. After setting `ATE`, you can now see all the commands you input together with the replies. Try again `AT` and you should see it on the terminal followed by `OK`, as shown in **Figure 49**.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

If you haven't received an `OK` or any reply, you need to check if the wiring of your UART lines is correct and if the baud is correctly configured to 115200. Also, you can check if the device is powered correctly. If you are getting power from a USB port, ensure that you have a good USB cable.

The ChirpStack or previously known as the LoRaServer project provides open-source components for building LoRaWAN networks. Like the case of TTN, the RAK3172 Evaluation Board is located in the periphery and will transmit the data to the backend servers through a LoRaWAN gateway. Learn more about [ChirpStack](https://www.chirpstack.io/).

:::tip üìù NOTE:

It is assumed that you are using RAK Gateway and its built-in ChirpStack. Also, the gateway with the ChirpStack must be configured successfully. For further information, check the RAK documents for more details.

:::

* In summary, these are the requirements: 

  1. Have ChirpStack online gateway, the frequency band of the nodes should be consistent with the frequency band of the gateway in use.
      *	[Connect the Gateway with Chirpstack](/Product-Categories/WisGate/RAK7243/Quickstart/#connect-the-gateway-with-chirpstack)
  2.	The RAK Serial Port Tool provided by RAK
  3.	RAK3172 Evaluation Board

:::tip üìù NOTE:
The frequency band used in the demonstration is EU868. Use a high-frequency version of RAK3172. The product number should be ‚Äú**RAK3172 (H)**‚Äù.

##### OTAA Configuration for Chirpstack

The RAK3172 Evaluation Board supports a series of AT commands to configure its internal parameters and control the functionalities of the board. 

1. To set up the RAK3172 Evaluation Board to join the Chirpstack using OTAA, start by connecting the RAK3172 Evaluation Board to the Computer (see **Figure 21**) and open the RAK Serial Port Tool. Select the right COM port and set the baud rate to 115200.

It is recommended to start by testing the serial communication and verify that the current configuration is working by sending these two AT commands:

```
AT
```

```
ATE
```

`ATE` will echo the commands you input to the board which is useful for tracking the commands and troubleshooting.

You will receive `OK` when you input the two commands. After setting `ATE`, you can now see all the commands you input together with the replies. Try again `AT` and you should see it on the terminal followed by `OK`, as shown in **Figure 67**.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

If you haven't received an `OK` or any reply, you need to check if the wiring of your UART lines is correct and if the baud is correctly configured to 115200. Also, you can check if the device is powered correctly. If you are getting power from a USB port, ensure that you have a good USB cable.

| Parameter | Description                                                 |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| w         | Join command - 1: joining, 0: stop joining.                 |
| x         | Auto-join config - 1: auto-join on powerup, 0: no auto-join |
| y         | Reattempt interval in seconds (7-255) - 8 is default.       |
| z         | Number of join attempts (0-255) - 0 is default.             |


5. After 5 or 6 seconds, if the request is successfully received by a LoRaWAN gateway, then you should see JOINED status reply.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

- If the OTAA device join failed, you need to check if your device is within reach of a working LoRaWAN gateway that is configured to connect to Chirpstack. It is also important to check that all your OTAA parameters (DEVEUI and APPKEY) are correct by using `AT+DEVEUI=?` and `AT+APPKEY=?` commands. Lastly, ensure that the antenna of your device is properly connected.

- After checking all the things above, try to join again. 
:::

6. With the end-device properly activated, you can now try to send some payload after successful join.

```
AT+SEND=2:12345678
```

Send command format: **`AT+SEND=<port>:<payload>`**

##### Chirpstack ABP Device Registration

1. During the registration of a new device, if you select ‚Äú**DeviceProfile_ABP**‚Äù, as shown in **Figure 72**, then the ChirpStack platform will assume that this device will join the LoRaWAN network using the ABP mode. 


:::tip üìù NOTE:

Check ‚Äú**Disable counting frame verification**‚Äù. During the test, when the board is restarted, the frame counting number will be also be restarted from zero. This would cause a synchronization problem with the ChirpStack server treating it as a replay attack. For the testing purpose, it is safe to disable this feature, but remember to activate it in a production environment.

  width="100%"
  caption="ChirpStack Console, Configuring a Device"
/>


2. After selecting the ABP mode, the following parameters appear in the Activation tab: 

Then, you can see that there are some parameters for ABP in the **‚ÄúACTIVATION‚Äù** item:

  *	**Device address**
  *	**Network Session Key**
  *	**Application Session Key**

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-evaluation-board/quickstart/43.abp-activation-parameters.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Chirpstack ABP Activation Parameters Needed"
/>

3. The parameters can be generated as random numbers by the platform or can be set with user values. Once these parameters are filled properly, the process is completed by clicking on the ‚Äú**ACTIVATE DEVICE**‚Äù button.


##### ABP Configuration for Chirpstack

1. To set up the RAK3172 Evaluation Board to join the Chirpstack using ABP, start by connecting the RAK3172 Evaluation Board to the Computer (see **Figure 21**) and open the RAK Serial Port Tool. Select the right COM port and set the baud rate to 115200.

It is recommended to start by testing the serial communication and verify that the current configuration is working by sending these two AT commands:

```
AT
```

```
ATE
```

`ATE` will echo the commands you input to the board which is useful for tracking the commands and troubleshooting.

You will receive `OK` when you input the two commands. After setting `ATE`, you can now see all the commands you input together with the replies. Try again `AT` and you should see it on the terminal followed by `OK`, as shown in **Figure 74**.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

If you haven't received an `OK` or any reply, you need to check if the wiring of your UART lines is correct and if the baud is correctly configured to 115200. Also, you can check if the device is powered correctly. If you are getting power from a USB port, ensure that you have a good USB cable.
:::

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-evaluation-board/quickstart/atstart.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="at+version command response"
/>


2. The next step is to configure the ABP LoRaWAN parameters in RAK3172: 

- LoRa work mode: **LoRaWAN**
- LoRaWAN join mode: **ABP**
- LoRaWAN class: **Class A**
- LoRaWAN region: **EU868** 

Set the work mode to LoRaWAN. It can be set to P2P as well but by default the device is in LoRaWAN mode.

```
AT+NWM=1
```

Set the LoRaWAN activation to ABP.

```
AT+NJM=0
```

Set the LoRaWAN class to Class A.

```
AT+CLASS=A
```

Set the frequency/region to EU868.

```
AT+BAND=4
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:

Depending on the Regional Band you selected, you might need to configure the sub-band of your RAK3172 to match the gateway and LoRaWAN network server. This is specially important on Regional Bands like US915, AU915, and CN470.

To configure the masking of channels for the sub-bands, you can use the [AT+MASK command](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK3172-Evaluation-Board/AT-Command-Manual/#at-mask) that can be found on the AT Commands Manual.

To illustrate, you can use use sub-band 2 by sending the command `AT+MASK=0002`.
:::

**List of band parameter options**

| Code     | Regional Band |
| -------- | ------------- |
| 0        | EU433         |
| 1        | CN470         |
| 2        | RU864         |
| 3        | IN865         |
| 4        | EU868         |
| 5        | US915         |
| 6        | AU915         |
| 7        | KR920         |
| 8 or 8-1 | AS923-1       |
| 8-2      | AS923-2       |
| 8-3      | AS923-3       |
| 8-4      | AS923-4       |

3. After configuration of the LoRaWAN parameters, the next step is to setup the device address and session keys. You need the use the values from the TTN device console. 

- Device Address: **26011AF9**
- Application Session Key: **4D42EC5CAF97F03D833CDAf5003F69E1**
- Network Session Key: **C280CB8D1DF688BC18601A97025C5488**


Set the Device Address.

```
AT+DEVADDR=26011AF9
```

Set the Application Session Key.

```
AT+APPSKEY=4D42EC5CAF97F03D833CDAf5003F69E1
```

Set the Network Session Key.

```
AT+NWKSKEY=C280CB8D1DF688BC18601A97025C5488
```

/>

4. After EUI and keys configuration, the device can now join the network and send some payload.

```
AT+JOIN=1:0:10:8
```

Join command format: **`AT+JOIN=w:x:y:z`**

| Parameter | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| w         | Join command - 1: joining, 0: stop joining.                  |
| x         | Auto-join config - 1: auto-join on power up, 0: no auto-join |
| y         | Reattempt interval in seconds (7-255) - 8 is default.        |
| z         | Number of join attempts (0-255) - 0 is default.              |

5. After 5 or 6 seconds, if the request was successfully received by a LoRaWAN gateway, then you should see JOINED status reply.

You can now try to send some payload after successful join.

```
AT+SEND=2:12341234
```
Send command format: **`AT+SEND=<port>:<payload>`**

#### LoRa P2P Mode

This section will show you how to set up and connect two RAK3172-E units to work in the LoRa P2P mode. The configuration of the RAK3172-E units is done by connecting the two boards to a general-purpose computer using a USB. The setup of each RAK3172 can be done separately, but testing the LoRa P2P mode will require having both units connected simultaneously. This could be done by having one computer with two USB ports or two computers with one USB port each.

It is recommended to start by testing the serial communication and verify the current configuration is working by sending these two AT commands:

```
AT
```

```
ATE
```

`ATE` will echo the commands you input to the board which is useful for tracking the commands and troubleshooting.

You will receive `OK` when you input the two commands. After setting `ATE`, you can now see all the commands you input together with the replies.

Try again `AT` and you should see it on the terminal followed by `OK`.


<rk-img

  width="90%"
  caption="at+version command response"
/>

1. To set up the RAK3172-E to work in LoRa P2P mode, you need to input the work mode command on both RAK3172 Evaluation Boards.

```
AT+NWM=0
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-evaluation-board/quickstart/p2pworkmode.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="P2P Mode"
/>

:::tip üìù NOTE:

You might need to input `ATE` command again to ensure that your succeeding commands on P2P mode echo on the terminal.

:::

For this P2P setup, the LoRa parameters are the following:

- Link frequency: **868000000&nbsp;Hz**
- Spreading factor: **7**
- Bandwidth: **125&nbsp;kHz**
- Coding Rate: 0 = **4/5**
- Preamble Length: **10**
- Power: **14&nbsp;dBm**

2. Input the P2P setup on both RAK3172 Evaluation Boards. The parameters should be exactly the same on the two boards. 

```
AT+P2P=868000000:7:125:0:10:14
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:

Refer to the [P2P Mode](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK3172-Evaluation-Board/AT-Command-Manual/) section of the AT command documentation to learn more about the definition of the parameters used.

  width="90%"
  caption="Configuring P2P in both RAK3172 Evaluation Boards"
/>


2. To set one module as receiver (RX), you need set the value of P2P receive command to 65535.

```
AT+PRECV=65535 
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:

- If `AT+PRECV` value is set to 65534, the device will continuously listen to P2P LoRa TX packets without any timeout. This is the same as setting the device in RX mode.
- If `AT+PRECV` value is set to 65535, the device will listen to P2P TX without a timeout. But it will stop listening once a P2P LoRa packet is received to save power.
- If `AT+PRECV` value is 0, the device will stop listening to P2P TX data. The device is in TX mode.

:::

With one board configured as RX, the other device will be the TX.

3. You can now try to send a P2P payload.

```
AT+PSEND=11223344
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-evaluation-board/quickstart/1.download-arduino.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Arduino IDE latest version"
/>

#### For Windows

::: tip üìù NOTE   
**For Windows 10 users**:   
Do **NOT** install the Arduino IDE from the Microsoft App store. Install the original Arduino IDE from the Arduino official website instead, since the Arduino app from the Microsoft App Store has problems using third-party Board Support Packages.
:::

1. Install the Arduino IDE, which you just downloaded, on your Windows PC. 

2. Click **I Agree** then **Next** to proceed.

<rk-img

After 100% progress, the Arduino IDE has been installed successfully.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-evaluation-board/quickstart/6.installation-success.png"
  width="45%"
  caption="Successful installation"
/>

#### For Linux

First, you need the check the compatibility with your system and choose between the 32-bit, 64-bit, and ARM versions of the Arduino IDE for Linux.

##### Installing via a tarball

After downloading the correct Arduino version, open a terminal, then run `ls` to check the installation file on the download folder.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-evaluation-board/quickstart/ls-arduino.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="Check the download folder"
/>


A tarball is a type of compressed folder, like a `.zip` file, commonly used to distribute software in Linux. To extract the files from the tarball, change the directory to where the downloaded tarball is, then run:

`tar xvf arduino-version.xz`

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-evaluation-board/quickstart/tar-linux.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="Tarball extract command"
/>

When the tar command finishes, run `ls` again. A folder named  **arduino-version** will be created.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-evaluation-board/quickstart/ls-tarball.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="Arduino install folder created"
/>

Change the current directory and go to the newly created folder directory. There will be a file named `install.sh` in the folder. Execute `sudo ./install.sh` to install the Arduino IDE.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-evaluation-board/quickstart/sudo-install.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="Arduino install script running"
/>

The `sudo` command temporarily elevates privileges allowing the installer to complete sensitive tasks without logging in as the root user.

#### For Mac OS X

In Mac OS X, the same as Linux, there is no installation process. It is just a process of decompression, then you can open Arduino IDE successfully.
