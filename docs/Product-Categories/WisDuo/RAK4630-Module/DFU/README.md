# Device Firmware Update

There will be situations in that you need to update the firmware of your RAK4630. Also, there are times when you want to reupload the firmware on your device to ensure that everything is set properly. Updating the Firmware of RAK4630 WisDuo can be done via USB connection or wirelessly using BLE via OTA DFU (Over-the-Air Device Firmware Upgrade). These methods are discussed in this guide. 

- [Firmware Update via USB](#firmware-update-via-usb)
- [Firmware Update via BLE Using OTA DFU](#firmware-update-using-ble-via-ota-dfu)

## Prerequisites

### What Do You Need?

- [nRFutil utility program](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfutil/releases)
- nRF Connect Mobile application
   - [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nrf-connect-for-mobile/id1054362403)
   - [Android Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.mcp&hl=en&gl=US)
- [DFU Distribution Package](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/RUI/RUI3/Image/RAK4631_latest_dfu_package.zip)

## Firmware Update via USB

You need to have a direct connection to the USB bus of RAK4630 before you can proceed with the update. You can check the minimum schematic required in the [quick start guide hardware setup section](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK4630-Module/Quickstart/#hardware-setup). This guide covers the three most popular operating systems:

- [Using Windows](/Product-Categories/wisduo/rak4630-module/DFU/#for-windows)
- [Using Linux](/Product-Categories/wisduo/rak4630-module/DFU/#for-linux)
- [Using MacOS](/Product-Categories/wisduo/rak4630-module/DFU/#for-macos)

### For Windows

#### Setup the nRFutil Utility and Environment

1. Download the [nRFutil.exe](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfutil/releases) and the latest [DFU Distribution Package](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/RUI/RUI3/Image/RAK4631_latest_dfu_package.zip). 
2. Once you downloaded the listed files, put them in the same directory/folder on your computer.

#### Setup the Device Console Port in Windows

::: tip üìù NOTE
- This section uses Tera Term for the Terminal emulation utility.
- USB interface is used. Disregard the Baud Rate setting. 
:::

1. Download the Tera Term Terminal emulator utility or any console utility you prefer. 

2. After downloading and installing the console utility, open the Tera Term and click Setup in the Menu bar.

<rk-img

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4630-module/quickstart/device-manager.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Check the port in the device manager"
/>

#### Check the Device Firmware Version

To get the device firmware version, use the `AT+VER` command. 

```
AT+VER?
AT+VER: get the version of the firmware

OK

AT+VER=?
AT+VER=3.2.0-p2_22q1_final.87

OK
```

#### Connect the Device To the DFU Mode

To enter the bootloader mode for firmware upgrade, execute the following steps:

1. Type the command `AT+BOOT` in the Tera Term or any terminal you use.
2. Before upgrading the dfu package, confirm the device into the bootloader mode.
3. The device will reset automatically.
4. After that, close the Tera Term to disconnect the device.

```
AT+BOOT
```


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4630-module/quickstart/disconnect-device.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Disconnect the device from Tera Term"
/>


#### Firmware Update via USB

1. Open the Windows Command Prompt application, then change the location where you put the [nRFutil utility program](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfutil/releases) and [DFU Distribution Package](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/RUI/RUI3/Image/RAK4631_latest_dfu_package.zip). 
2. After that, you can now execute the update using the following command:

`nrfutil dfu usb-serial -pkg RAK4631_latest_dfu_package.zip -p COM4`

::: tip üìù NOTE
Check if the firmware version is already upgraded.
:::

### For Linux

#### Setup the Linux Environment

1. First, open a new terminal, then install all dependencies.


```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install net-tools git curl python xclip python3-pip
```

2. The following prerequisite must be installed: `Python 3.7` or later. Check your Python version, as shown in **Figure 6**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4630-module/dfu/python-version.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="Check Python version"
/>

3. Add `.local` folder to Linux `$PATH` variable.

```
export PATH="$HOME/.local:$PATH"
```

4. Now, you can install `nrfutil`. It is available as a package in the Python Package Index (PyPI). Execute the following commands:

```
sudo apt-get update
pip3 install nrfutil --user
```

#### Setup the Device Console Port in Linux

1. Install the minicom using the following commands:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install minicom
```

2. To open the minicom terminal utility with the ttyACM0 interface. The correct port name can be determined using `dmesg`, as shown in the [next steps](/Product-Categories/wisduo/rak4630-module/DFU/#execute-the-firmware-update-via-usb).

Enter the following code: `minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0`


#### Execute the Firmware Update via USB 

1. Download the zip file [DFU Distribution Package](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/RUI/V3/Image/). 

When you plug in the RAK4630 through the USB to Linux, you will see the related information "**cdc_acm 1-1:1.0:  ttyACM0: USB ACM device**" from the `dmesg` command.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4630-module/dfu/dmesg-tty.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="Checking USB CDC device using dmesg command"
/>

In this case, the RAK4630 **USB CDC** device name is `/dev/ttyACM0`.

2. Perform the steps described in the section [Setup the Device Console Port in Linux](#setup-the-device-console-port-in-linux).

3. On minicom, enter the following AT command:

```
AT+BOOT
```

4. Now, open the terminal shell and go to the directory where you put the DFU Distribution Package. After that, execute the following command:

`nrfutil dfu usb-serial -pkg RAK4631_latest_dfu_package.zip -p /dev/ttyACM0`


5. To check the device firmware version in the minicom console, enter the following AT command:

```
AT+VER=?
```

You should see then the current FW version of the module.

### For MacOS

1. Download [nrfutil](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfutil/releases/download/v6.1.3/nrfutil-mac.1). Usually, the `nrfutil-mac.1` file will go to the downloads folder. This section assumes any downloaded file goes to the downloads folder.

2. Open the terminal and go to the downloads directory or the location where you put the downloaded file. You have to change the `username` based on your machine. In this guide, `apple` is used as the user.

```
cd /Users/username/Downloads
```

3. Make the `nrfutil-mac.1` executable.

```
chmod +x nrfutil-mac.1
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4630-module/dfu/downloads-chmod-nrfutil.png"
  width="60%"
  caption="Download nrfutil for macOS"
/>

4. You also need to determine the port name of the RAK4630 using the command:

```
ls /dev/cu.*
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4630-module/dfu/rak4631-r-port.png"
  width="60%"
  caption="Check the port"
/>

5. Download the [RAK4630 Firmware](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/RUI/RUI3/Image/RAK4631_latest_dfu_package.zip). Usually, the `RAK4631_latest_dfu_package.zip` file will go to the downloads folder.

6. Open a serial terminal software and run `AT+BOOT` to enable the bootloader mode of RAK4630.

```
AT+BOOT
```

7. You can now execute the firmware update.

::: tip üìù NOTE
- The `nrfutil-mac.1` must be on the same folder as the `RAK4631_latest_dfu_package.zip`. In this guide, it is the **Downloads** folder.
- You should be connected to the right port. The port name in your computer might be different than the one in this guide.
- It might take a while for the update. Do not remove the USB or terminate the terminal application while doing the uploading process.
:::

```
./nrfutil-mac.1 dfu usb-serial -pkg RAK4631_latest_dfu_package.zip -p /dev/cu.usbmodemC0D048F6604F1
```
