## Product Description

The **RAK811 Breakout Board** is specifically designed to allow easy access to the pins on the board in order to simplify development and testing. The breakout board utilized is based on **Xbee form factor**. Its main purpose is to allow the [RAK811 stamp module](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK811-Module/Overview/) form factor pinout to be transferred to 2.54&nbsp;mm headers. This makes it more convenient to work on your projects.

The RAK811 Breakout Board complies with Class A & C of LoRaWAN 1.0.2 specifications. It can easily connect to different LoRaWAN server platforms like TheThingsNetwork (TTN), Chirpstack, Actility, etc. It also supports LoRa Point to Point (P2P) communication mode which helps you in implementing your own customized long-range LoRa network quickly.

The RAK811 module is integrated with Semtechâ€™s SX1276 and STM32. You can configure the mode and operation of the module using AT commands via a UART interface. RAK811 also offers low power features which is very suitable for battery-powered applications.
