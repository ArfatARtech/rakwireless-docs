  caption="RAK811 Breakout Board in the context of the TTN"
/>

As shown in Figure 6, the RAK811 Breakout Board is one of the devices located on the left side. In the context of an IoT solution, the objective is to deploy devices to sense relevant process variables and transmit the data to the backend servers located in the cloud. The data will be processed and integrated as part of a larger solution that ultimately could generate efficiency, traceability and predictability capacity among others.

The RAK811 Breakout Board can be part of this ecosystem, and the objective of this section is to demonstrate how simple it is to send data to the TTN using the LoRaWAN protocol. To achieve this, the RAK811 Breakout Board must be located inside of the coverage of a LoRaWAN gateway. 


<b>Sign up and login</b>

If you don't have an account yet, head on to the [TTN website](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) and create one. Once done, login to your account and go to the Console.

#### LoRaWAN Join Mode


The LoRaWAN specification defines that to join in a LoRaWAN network, each end-device has to be personalized and activated. Activation can be done either via Over-The-Air-Activation (OTAA) or Activation-By-Personalization (ABP). In OTAA, the previously personalized end-device is activated when is deployed or reset. On the other hand, in ABP, the personalization and activation are done as a single step. 


Hence, this is referred to as the ‚Äú**Join Mode**". LoRaWAN allows the OTAA mode and the ABP mode. In this section, the configuration process of these two modes is explained, both on the platform side and the node side.


##### OTAA Mode

###### Configure the OTAA Mode on the Platform

As shown in the Figure 14, the default activation mode in TTN is the OTAA mode. Therefore, no further actions are required in the platform side. 

###### Configure the OTAA Mode on the RAK811 Breakout Board

The RAK811 Breakout Board supports a series of AT commands to configure its internal parameters and control the functionalities of the module. Physically, the module exposes a serial interface through the USB connector. 


To set up the RAK811 Breakout Board to join the TTN using OTAA, start by connecting the RAK811 Breakout Board to the Computer (see Figure 1) and open the RAK Serial Port Tool. Wait for the communication to start. It is recommended to test the serial communication and verify the current configuration by sending either of these two AT commands:

```
at+set_config=device:restart
```

```
at+version
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak811-breakout-board/quickstart/connecting-to-ttn/3.command-response.png"
  width="40%"
  caption="at+version command response"
/>


As an example, these are the list of the parameters you need to configure in RAK811 Breakout Board: 

- LoRa join mode: **OTAA**
- LoRa class: **Class A**
- LoRa region: **EU868** 
- Device EUI: **5e9d1e0857cf25f1**
- Application EUI: **5e9d1e0857cf25f1**
- Application Key: **f921d50cd7d02ee3c5e6142154f274b2**


1. Set the LoRa join mode to OTAA.

```
at+set_config=lora:join_mode:0
```

2. Set the LoRa class to Class A.

```
at+set_config=lora:class:0
```

3. Set the frequency/region to EU868.

* Refer in the [RAK811 Breakout Board Datasheet](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK811-Breakout-Board/Datasheet/#rf-characteristics) for the list of supported frequencies.


```

##### ABP Mode

###### Configure the ABP mode on the Platform


If the ABP mode is preferred, then the TTN platform needs to be configured first accordingly. At TTN, once a device is created, you can select the ‚Äú**SETTINGS**‚Äù section of the ‚Äú**DEVICE**‚Äù and switch the ‚Äú**Activation Method**‚Äù.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak811-breakout-board/quickstart/connecting-to-ttn/17.abp-mode.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="ABP Activation in TTN"
/>

* For ABP mode, the TTN parameters needed are the following:

  * **Device Address**
  * **Network Session Key**
  * **App Session Key**

:::tip üìù NOTE:
These fields can be left empty in the form and TTN will complete them with random values. In other cases, you can complete them with specific values.

###### Configure the ABP mode on the RAK811

To set up the RAK811 Breakout Board to join the TTN using ABP, start by connecting the RAK811 board to the Computer via a USB to UART converter (see Figure 2) and open the RAK Serial Port Tool. Wait for the communication to start. It is recommended to test the serial communication by sending either of these two AT commands:

```
at+set_config=device:restart
```

```
at+version
```

  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak811-breakout-board/quickstart/connecting-to-ttn/3.command-response.png"
  width="40%"
  caption="at+version command response"
/>

As an example, these are the list of the parameters you need to configure in RAK811: 

- LoRa join mode: **ABP**
- LoRa class: **Class A**
- LoRa region: **EU868** 
- Device address: **26011af9**
- Network Session Key: **c280cb8d1df688bc18601a97025c5488**
- Application Session Key: **4d42ec5caf97f03d833cdaf5003f69e1**



1. Set the LoRa join mode to ABP.

```
at+set_config=lora:join_mode:1
```
2. Set the LoRa class to Class A.

```
at+set_config=lora:class:0

### LoRa P2P Mode

This section shows how to use LoRa P2P mode. You will be using EU868 as the frequency, although it is applicable to other standard bands.

1. First, find two RAK811 Breakout Board which can work on EU868 frequency and make sure their firmware version isn‚Äôt less than V3.0.0.1.

2. Next, connect these two RAK811 Breakout Board with PC through UART, and open two serial port tool on PC.

3. Now, configure them to both work in LoRaP2P mode as follow:

```sh
at+set_config=lora:work_mode:1
```
