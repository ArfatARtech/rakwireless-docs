## Product Configuration

### Connecting to the RAK4200 Console

During the configuration of the module through the AT commands, it is possible to read the console outputs. You can connect to the console of the RAK4200 module: through the UART interface.

#### Connect to the RAK4200

In this document, a RAK4200 module is used for demonstration. Use a USB to TTL module to connect to the module. In case the RAK4200 is mounted on an evaluation board or on a customized PCB then use the appropriate interface to connect to the Serial port.

1. Connect the RAK4200 to the serial port of a general-purpose (e.g.: USB port) using a USB to TTL adapter, as shown in the figure.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4200-module/quickstart/module-connection.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="RAK4200 module connection"
/>

2. Any serial communication tool will work, but it is recommended to use the RAK Serial Port Tool that can be downloaded from [here](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/en/LoRa/Tools/RAK_SERIAL_PORT_TOOL_V1.2.1.zip).

3. Configure the serial communication tool by selecting the proper port of the computer UART port and configure the link as: 115200 bauds, 8 bits, no parity bit, and 1 stop bit.

4. The RAK4200 console output can now be read in the RAK Serial Port Tool as shown in figure below.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4200-module/quickstart/serial-port-tool.png"
  width="50%"
  caption="RAK serial port tool connected to RAK4200"
/>

#### Configure RAK4200

In order to connect the RAK4200 module to a LoRa-P2P connection or a LoRaWAN network, the module must be configured and LoRa parameters must be set by sending AT commands through the UART interface.

Connect the RAK4200 module to the computer as described in the previous section. Using the Serial communication tool then is possible to send commands to the RAK4200, e.g.: sending the `at+version` will return and display the current firmware version as shown in the figure below. For more supported commands, refer to [AT Commands for RAK4200](../AT-Command-Manual/).

### Connecting to The Things Network (TTN)

This section shows how to connect the RAK4200 module to The Things Network (TTN‚Ñ¢) platform.
As described in the TTN‚Äôs website:
"The engine of The Things Network is our technology - a robust yet flexible and enterprise-ready LoRaWAN network server stack. Our stack caters to the needs of demanding LoRaWAN deployments, from covering the essentials to advanced security configurations and device life cycle management. Backed by SLAs to meet your availability requirements, facilitated by our team of support engineers"

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4200-module/quickstart/RAK4200-ttn.png"
  width="80%"
  caption="RAK4200 in the context of the TTN"
/>

As shown in figure above, the RAK4200 module is one of the devices located on the left side. In the context of an IoT solution, the objective is to deploy devices to sense the relevant process variables and transmit the data to the backend servers located in the cloud. The data will be processed and integrated as part of a larger solution that, ultimately, could generate efficiency, traceability, predictability capacity among others.

The RAK4200 module can be part of this ecosystem, and the objective of this section is to demonstrate how simple is to send data to TTN using LoRaWAN. Users must be aware that to achieve this, the RAK4200 must be located inside of coverage of a LoRaWAN gateway.

In summary, these are the requirements:

- Have an account on the TTN website.
- Have access to a LoRaWAN gateway subscribed to the TTN. (The frequency band set for the RAK4200 needs to be consistent with the frequency band of the gateway.)
  [Add gateway configuration TTN network server document link]()
- The "serial port tool" provided by RAKWireless.
- The RAK4200 module.

::: tip üìù NOTE
The frequency band used in this example is EU868 which is supported by the high-frequency version of the RAK4200 module.
:::

The steps for sending data to the TTN platform from a RAK4200 module can be summarized as:

- Sign up to TTN platform and login to the TTN‚Äôs platform.
- Create a new Application.
- Register a new device in the platform
- Configure the Join Mode
   - OTAA mode on the platform
   - OTAA mode on the RAK4200 module
   - ABP mode on the platform
   - ABP mode on the RAK4200 module
   - Send data from the module and receive it at the platform

In the following sections, it will be explained in detail each of these steps. The user must choose to use ABP or OTAA mode to register the device to the network server.

#### Registering the RAK4200 to TTN

  width="100%"
  caption="TTN‚Äôs Console, the results of creating a new Device."
/>

#### LoRaWAN Join Mode

The LoRaWAN specification defines that to join in a LoRaWAN network, each end-device has to be personalized and activated. Activation can be done either via Over-The-Air-Activation (OTAA) or via Activation-By-Personalization (ABP). In OTAA the end-device previously personalized is activated when is deployed or reset. In ABP, personalization and activation are done as a single step.

##### Join in OTAA mode

###### Configure the OTAA mode on the TTN platform

As shown in figure below, the default activation mode in TTN is the OTAA mode. Therefore, no further actions are required on the platform side.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4200-module/quickstart/ttn-console-6.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="TTN‚Äôs Console, the results of creating a new Device."
/>

Three parameters from TTN setup are used to configure the RAK4200: ‚ÄúDevice EUI‚Äù, ‚ÄúApplication EUI‚Äù and ‚ÄúApp Key‚Äù.

###### Configure the OTAA mode on the RAK4200 module

### Connecting with ChirpStack

This section shows how to connect the RAK4200 module to the ChirpStack platform. As described in the ChripsStack‚Äôs website:

‚ÄúThe ChirpStack open-source LoRaWAN Network Server stack provides open-source components for LoRaWAN networks. Together they form a ready-to-use solution including a user-friendly web-interface for device management and APIs for integration.

The modular architecture makes it possible to integrate within existing infrastructures. All components are licensed under the MIT license and can be used for commercial purposes.‚Äù

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4200-module/quickstart/RAK4200-module.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="RAK4200 module in the context of the ChirpStack platform"
/>

The architecture of the ChirpStack platform is shown in Figure 24. Similar to the case of TTN, the RAK4200 module is located in the periphery and will transmit the data to the backend servers through a LoRa gateway. More information about this architecture can be found [here](https://www.chirpstack.io/).

In this document, it is assumed that users are using a RAK LoRa gateway, such as RAK7243. The gateway must be configured and registered previously to Chirpstack deployment. More information about that can be found [here](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/en/LoRa/).

::: tip üìù NOTE
The frequency band used in this example is EU868 which is supported by the high-frequency version of RAK4200.
:::

And these are the steps to send data to the ChirpStack platform from a RAK4200 module:

- Request an account to RAK and login to the RAK‚Äôs ChirpStack platform.
- Create a new Application.
- Register a new device on the platform:
- Configure the Join Mode:
  - OTAA mode on the platform
  - OTAA mode on the RAK4200 module
  - ABP mode on the platform
  - ABP mode on the RAK4200 module
  - Send data from the module and receive it at the platform

The following section gives the details of each of these aforementioned steps. As usual, the user must choose to use ABP or OTAA mode to register the device to the network server.

#### Registering the RAK4200 to ChirpStack

##### Sign up to Chirpstack.io and login to the platform.

Request an account in the forum of RAK, then access to server assigned for your region with your username and password.

##### Create a new Application

#### LoRaWAN Join Mode

The LoRaWAN specification defines that to join in a LoRaWAN network, each end-device has to be personalized and activated. Activation can be done either via Over-The-Air-Activation (OTAA) or via Activation-By-Personalization (ABP). In OTAA the end-device previously personalized is activated when is deployed or reset. In ABP, personalization and activation are done as a single step.

##### Join in OTAA Mode

###### Configure the OTAA mode on the platform

If you have selected ‚ÄúDeviceProfile_OTAA‚Äù as shown in Figure 33, then after the device is created, an Application Key must be also created for this device.

::: tip üìù NOTE
Standard OTAA mode requires the Device EUI, Application Key and the Application EUI, but in the ChirpStack‚Äôs implementation, only Device EUI and the Application Key are mandatory. The Application EUI is not required and is not recorded in the Application tab. Nevertheless, the Application EUI is a mandatory parameter in the RAK4200 module‚Äôs firmware, in order to resolve this mismatch, users can reuse the Device EUI as the Application EUI during the configuration in the side of the node.
:::

###### Configure the OTAA mode on the RAK4200 module

RAK4200 complies with LoRaWAN 1.0.2, by default the LoRa join mode is OTAA and the LoRa Class is Class A.
To set up the RAK4200 module to join ChirpStack using OTAA start by connecting the RAK4200 module to the Computer (as in Figure 1) and open the RAK Serial Port Tool, wait for the communication to start. It is recommended to test the serial communication by sending an AT command as `at+get_config=lora:status` or `at+version`.

### LoRa P2P Mode

This section will show how to set and link two RAK4200 units to work in LoRa P2P mode.
The two RAK4200 units shall be set to operate at the same frequency, e.g: EU868.

As shown in the previous sections, the setup of the RAK4200 units is done by connecting them with a general-purpose computer through the UART port. The setup of each RAK4200 can be done separately, but testing the LoRa P2P mode will require having both units connected simultaneously to a UART port (this could be one computer with 2 ports or 2 computers with one UART port each).

To set the RAK4200 to work in LoRa P2P mode, open the RAK Serial port tool and send the command as in Figure 48: `at+set_config=lora:work_mode:1`

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4200-module/quickstart/RAK4200-setting.png"
  width="50%"
  caption="RAK4200 setting to LoRa P2P mode"
/>

Configure the LoRa P2P parameters for both units. The command for setting the parameters has the format.
`at+set_config=lorap2p:XXX:Y:Z:A:B:C`

From Table 6 the parameters are:

- XXX: Frequency in Hz.
- Y: Spreading factor, [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].
- Z: Bandwidth, [0: 125 kHz,1: 250 kHz,2: 500kHz]
- A: Coding Rate, [1: 4/5, 2: 4/6, 3: 4/7, 4: 4/8]
- B: Preamble Length, 5~65535.
- C: Power in dBm, 5~20.

For this example, the LoRa parameters are:

- Link frequency: 869525000 Hz
- Spreading factor:7
- Bandwidth: 125 kHz
- Coding Rate:4/5
- Preamble Length: 5
- Power: 5 dBm

Which is translated into the following RAK4200 AT command and that is sent to both units as shown in Figure 49:
`at+set_config=lorap2p:869525000:7:0:1:5:5`

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4200-module/quickstart/setting-both-units.png"
  width="50%"
  caption="Setting both RAK4200 units with the LoRa P2P parameters"
/>

Next, set the transmission mode of the module. In this example, Unit 1 is set to sender mode, and unit 2 is set to receiver mode by AT command. See Figure 50.

Unit 1(Sender): `at+set_config=lorap2p:transfer_mode:2`
Unit 2(Receiver): `at+set_config=lorap2p:transfer_mode:1`

  width="100%"
  caption="Set the module in the sender (left) and in the receiver (right) mode"
/>

Now, to send a message with the string ‚Äú123456890‚Äù from Unit1 to Unit2, use the command on Unit 1
`at+send=lorap2p:1234567890`

The message will be automatically received by Unit 2 (see Figure 51).
