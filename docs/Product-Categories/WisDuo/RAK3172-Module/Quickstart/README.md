## Product Configuration

### RAK3172 as a Stand-Alone Device Using RUI3

#### Hardware Setup

The RAK3172 requires a few hardware connections before you can make it work. The bare minimum requirement is to have the power section properly configured, reset button, antenna, and USB connection.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
Firmware update is done via UART2 pins. If you will connect the module to an external device that will be interfacing with UART2, take extra precautions in your board design to ensure you can still perform FW update to it. There should be a way in your board design that can disconnect the external device to RAK3172 UART2 before connecting the module to the PC (via USB-UART converter) for the FW update process.

An alternative option to update firmware aside from UART2 is to use SWD pins (SWCLK & SWDIO). This method will require you to use external tools like ST-LINK and RAKDAP1.

  width="60%"
  caption="RAK3172 Minimum Schematic"
/>

Ensure that the antenna is properly connected to have a good LoRa signal. Also, note that you can damage the RF section of the chip if you power the module without an antenna connected to the IPEX connector.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/wisblock_antenna.png"
  width="30%"
  caption="LoRa Antenna"
/>

RAK3172 has a module variant with an IPEX connector where you can connect the LoRa antenna, as shown in **Figure 3**. If the RAK3172 module you ordered is the variant with no IPEX connector, you need to ensure that there is an external antenna connected to **RF pin** (PIN 12) of the module.

:::tip üìù NOTE
Detailed information about the RAK3172 LoRa antenna can be found on the [antenna datasheet](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/LoRa/WisBlock/Accessories/). 
:::

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
When using the LoRa transceiver, make sure that an antenna is always connected. Using this transceiver without an antenna can damage the module.
:::

#### Software Setup

The default firmware of RAK3172 is based on RUI3, which allows you to develop your custom firmware to connect sensors and other peripherals to it. To develop your custom firmware using Arduino IDE, you need first to add **RAKwireless RUI STM32 Boards** in the Arduino board manager, which will be discussed in this guide. You can then use [RUI3 APIs](https://docs.rakwireless.com/RUI3/Arduino-API/) for your intended application. You can upload the custom firmware via UART. The AT commands of RAK3172 is still available even if you compile custom firmware via RUI3. You can send AT commands via UART2 connection.

##### RAK3172 RUI3 Board Support Package in Arduino IDE

If you don't have an Arduino IDE yet, you can download it on the [Arduino official website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and follow the installation procedure in the [miscellaneous section](/Product-Categories/wisduo/RAK3172-Module/Quickstart/#arduino-installation) of this document.

::: tip üìù NOTE   
**For Windows 10 and up users**:   
If your Arduino IDE is installed from the Microsoft App Store, you need to reinstall your Arduino IDE by getting it from the Arduino official website. The Arduino app from the Microsoft App Store has problems using third-party Board Support Packages.

##### LoRaWAN Example

This example illustrates how to program RAK3172 module as a stand-alone LoRaWAN end-device via [RUI3 Arduino APIs](https://docs.rakwireless.com/RUI3/Arduino-API/). To use RAK3172 module as a LoRaWAN end-device, it needs to be within reach of a working **LoRaWAN gateway** registered to a **LoRaWAN network server(LNS)** or with a built-in network server.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
If you are new to LoRaWAN, here are a few good references about LoRaWAN and gateways:

- [LoRaWAN 101](https://news.rakwireless.com/lorawan-r-101-all-you-need-to-know/)
- [What is a LoRaWAN Gateway](https://news.rakwireless.com/what-is-a-lorawan-gateway/)
- [How do LoRaWAN¬Æ Gateways work?](https://news.rakwireless.com/how-do-lorawan-gateways-work/)
- [Things to Consider When Picking A LoRaWAN¬Æ Gateway](https://news.rakwireless.com/things-to-consider-when-picking-a-lorawan-gateway/)

RAKwireless LoRaWAN gateway models like [WisGate Edge](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisgate-edge) have built-in network servers. It is also common that the LoRaWAN network server is external or in the cloud. The popular LoRaWAN network server in the cloud that you can use for free (but offers enterprise service, too) is [TTN](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/).

To correctly run this example, it is necessary to configure the LoRaWAN parameters and create an OTAA application on your LoRaWAN gateway.

:::

###### Register the LoRaWAN Gateway on TTNv3 Community Edition

After configuring your gateway, you need to register it in TTNv3:

1. Login to TTNv3 Network Server with a web browser.

- [Europe](https://eu1.cloud.thethings.network/)
- [North America](https://nam1.cloud.thethings.network/)
- [Australia](https://au1.cloud.thethings.network/)

2. Navigate to the **Console** page and click on **gateway** icon, as shown in **Figure 20**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/ttnv3-initial.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="TTNv3 gateway registration and configuration"
/>

3. On **General Settings**, enter the **Gateway ID**, **Gateway EUI**, and **Gateway Name**. This information is available in your LoRaWAN gateway configuration. Select the **Gateway Server address** according to the region where the LoRaWAN gateway will be installed.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/ttnv3-gwconfig.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="TTNv3 gateway registration and configuration"
/>

4. Select the **Frequency plan** for your region (with used by TTN), then click on the **Create gateway** button. This will add a new gateway to TTNv3.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/ttnv3-add.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="TTNv3 add new Gateway"
/>

###### Register the Device on TTNv3

The next step is to follow the procedure described in the section [TTN OTAA Device Registration](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK3172-Module/Quickstart/#ttn-otaa-device-registration).

###### Uploading LoRaWAN Example to RAK3172

After a successful registration of the RAK3172 device on the LNS, you can now proceed with running the LoRaWAN OTAA demo application example.

1. Launch Arduino IDE and configure WisDuo RAK3172 Evaluation Board on board selection. See [Figure 9](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK3172-Module/Quickstart/#configure-rak3172-on-boards-manager).

2. Connect the RAK3172 via UART and check RAK3172 COM Port. See [Figure 10](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK3172-Module/Quickstart/#rak3172-com-port-on-device-manager).

3. Open the example code under **RAK WisBlock RUI examples**: **File** -> **Examples** -> **RAK WisBlock RUI examples** -> **Example** -> **LoRaWan_OTAA**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/otaa-rak3172.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="OTAA LoRaWAN application example"
/>

4. In the example code, you need to modify the device EUI **OTAA_DEVEUI**, the application EUI **OTAA_APPEUI**, and application key **OTAA_APPKEY**.

- The **OTAA_DEVEUI** parameter should match the device EUI registered in your network server. Note that your RAK3172 module has a sticker with QR code printed on it. You can use the QR code information to configure the **OTAA_DEVEUI** parameter. The **OTAA_DEVEUI** format is MSB first.

```c
  // OTAA Device EUI MSB
#define OTAA_DEVEUI   {0x70, 0xB3, 0xD5, 0x7E, 0xD0, 0x04, 0xF1, 0xC0}
```
- The **OTAA_APPEUI** parameter. This parameter should also be the same as the **APPEUI** in the network server you configured.

```c
  // OTAA Application EUI MSB
#define OTAA_APPEUI   {0x70, 0xB3, 0xD5, 0x7E, 0xD0,0x03, 0xAB, 0xA2}
```

- Another important parameter to change is the application key **OTAA_APPKEY**. This parameter should also be the same as the **APPKEY** in the network server you configured. The **OTAA_APPKEY** format is MSB first.

```c
// OTAA Application Key MSB
#define OTAA_APPKEY   {0xB4, 0x85, 0x7E, 0xFE, 0x1C, 0xB5, 0x15, 0xEB, 0x44, 0x61, 0x0D, 0x9B, 0x20, 0x6A, 0xF3, 0x3A}
```

  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/lorawan_otaa_parameter.png"
  width="190%"
  caption="Configuraing DEVEUI, APPEUI and APPKEY"
/>

3. Depending on the Regional Band you selected, you might need to configure the sub-band of your RAK module to match the gateway and LoRaWAN network server. This is especially important for Regional Bands like US915, AU915 and CN470. 

This guide uses US915 regional band, so you need to update the band in the code as well. In addition to that, you also need to set up the channel mask (channels 8 to 15 are the most commonly used channels in the US915 band).

```c
  if (!api.lorawan.band.set(OTAA_BAND)) {
    Serial.printf("LoRaWan OTAA - set band is incorrect! \r\n");
    return;
  } 
  uint16_t maskBuff = 0x0002;
  if (!api.lorawan.mask.set(&maskBuff)) {
    Serial.printf("LoRaWan OTAA - set mask is incorrect! \r\n");
    return;
  }

```

:::tip üìù NOTE:
RAK3172 supports the following regions:

* RAK_REGION_EU433 = 0

### RAK3172 as a LoRa/LoRaWAN Modem via AT Command

#### AT Command via UART2

RAK3172 module can be configured using AT commands via the UART2 interface. You need a USB to UART TTL adapter to connect the RAK3172 to your computer's USB port and a serial terminal tool. You can use the [RAK Serial Port Tool](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/en/LoRa/Tools) so you can easily send AT commands and view the replies from the console output. The RAK Serial Port Tool commands still uses the RUI V2 AT commands by default. You can modify it to have RUI3 AT commands and then save it.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
Firmware update and AT command functionality are done via UART2 pins. If you will connect the module to an external host MCU that will send AT commands via UART2, take extra precautions in your board design to ensure you can still perform FW update to it. There should be a way in your board design that can disconnect the host MCU UART to connect to RAK3172 UART2 before connecting the module to the PC (via USB-UART converter) for the FW update process.

An alternative option to update firmware aside from UART2 is to use SWD pins (SWCLK & SWDIO). This method will require you to use external tools like ST-LINK and RAKDAP1.
:::

##### Connect to the RAK3172

1. Connect the RAK3172 to the serial port of a general-purpose computer (USB port) using a USB to UART TTL adapter like [RAKDAP1](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/accessories/products/daplink-tool), as shown in **Figure 30**.

  width="55%"
  caption="RAK3172 Module Connection"
/>

2. Any serial communication tool can be used; but, it is recommended to use the [RAK Serial Port Tool](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/en/LoRa/Tools).

3. Configure the serial communication tool by selecting the proper port detected by the computer and configure the link as follows: 

 * Baud Rate: **115200 baud**
 * Data Bits: **8 bits**
 * Stop Bits: **1 stop bit**
 * Parity: **NONE**

##### RAK3172 Configuration for LoRaWAN or LoRa P2P

To enable the RAK3172 module as a LoRa P2P module or a LoRaWAN end-device, the module must be configured and parameters must be set by sending AT commands. You can configure the RAK3172 in two ways:

- [LoRaWAN End-Device](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK3172-Module/quickstart/#configuring-rak3172-as-lorawan-end-device) - RAK3172 as LoRaWAN IoT device.
- [LoRa P2P](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK3172-Module/quickstart/#lora-p2p-mode) - Point-to-point communication between two RAK3172 modules.

#### Configuring RAK3172 as LoRaWAN End-Device

To enable the RAK3172 module as a LoRaWAN end-device, a device must be registered first in the LoRaWAN network server. This guide will cover both TTN and Chirpstack LoRaWAN network servers and the associate AT commands for the RAK3172.

##### Connecting to The Things Network (TTN)

In this section, a quick tutorial guide will show how to connect the RAK3172 module to the TTN platform. 

:::tip üìù NOTE:

In this guide, you need to have a working gateway that is connected to TTN or you have to be within the coverage of a TTN community network.

:::

<rk-img

  width="95%"
  caption="RAK3172 EVB in the context of the TTN"
/>

As shown in **Figure 31**, The Things Stack (TTN V3) is an open-source LoRaWAN Network Server suitable for global, geo-distributed public and private deployments, as well as for small local networks. The architecture follows the LoRaWAN Network Reference Model for standards compliance and interoperability. This project is actively maintained by [The Things Industries](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/).

LoRaWAN is a protocol for low-power wide-area networks. It allows for large-scale Internet of Things deployments where low-powered devices efficiently communicate with Internet-connected applications over long-range wireless connections.

The RAK3172 WisDuo module can be part of this ecosystem as a device, and the objective of this section is to demonstrate how simple it is to send data to The Things Stack using the LoRaWAN protocol. To achieve this, the RAK3172 WisDuo module must be located inside the coverage of a LoRaWAN gateway connected to The Things Stack server.

##### Registration to TTN and Creating LoRaWAN Applications

1. The first step is to go to [The Things Network platform](https://console.cloud.thethings.network/) and select a cluster, as shown in **Figure 32**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/image_1.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Selecting Cluster in TTN V3"
/>

You can use the same login credentials on the TTN V2 if you have one. If you have no account yet, you need to create one.

2. To register as a new user to TTN, click on **Login with The Things ID** then select **register** on the next page, as shown in **Figure 33** and **Figure 34**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/image_2.png"

/>

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/image_3.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Registration of new account"
/>

3. You should now be on the step of creating your TTN account. Fill in all the necessary details and activate your account.

4. After creating an account, you should log in on the platform using your username/email and password then click **Submit**, as shown in **Figure 35**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/image_4.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Logging in to TTN platform"
/>

5. Click **Authorize** to proceed.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/image_5.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Authorization to TTN"
/>

6. Now that you are logged in to the platform, the next step is to create an application. Click **Create an application**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/image_6.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Creating TTN application for your LoRaWAN devices"
/>

7. To have an application registered, you need to input first the specific details and necessary information about your application then click **Create application**.
 
<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/image_7.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Details of the TTN application"
/>

8. If you had no error during the previous step, you should now be on the application console page. The next step is to add end-devices to your TTN application. LoRaWAN specification enforces that each end-device has to be personalized and activated. There are two options for registering devices depending on the activation mode you select. Activation can be done either via Over-The-Air-Activation (OTAA) or Activation-By-Personalization (ABP).

##### TTN OTAA Device Registration

1. Go to your application console to be able to register a device. To start adding an OTAA end-device, click **+ Add end device**, as shown in **Figure 39**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/image_8.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Add end device"
/>

2. To register the module, click first **Manually** then configure the activation method by selecting **Over the air activation (OTAA)** and compatible **LoRaWAN version** then click the **Start** button, as shown in **Figure 40** and **Figure 41**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/image_9.png"

/>

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/image_10.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Device activation configuration"
/>

3. Then you need to put a unique **End device ID** and EUIs (**DevEUI** and **AppEUI**), as shown in **Figure 42**. Check if your module has a DevEUI on the sticker or QR that you can scan then use this as the device unique DevEUI.

Optionally, you can add a more descriptive **End device name** and **End device description** about your device.

4. After putting all the details, you need to click **Network layer settings** to proceed to the next step.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

It is advisable to use a meaningful end-device ID, end-device name, and end-device description that will match your device's purpose. The end-device ID `rak-device` is for illustration purposes only.

:::

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/image_11.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="OTAA Device Information"
/>

5. The next step is to set up the **Frequency plan**, a compatible **Regional Parameter version**, and the **LoRaWAN class** supported. Then you can click **Join settings**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/image_12.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="OTAA Configuration"
/>

6. The last step in the registration of a new OTAA end-device is the configuration of the **AppKey**. To get the AppKey, you must click the **generate button**. Then click **Add end device** to finish your new device registration.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/image_13.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="OTAA AppKey generation and device registration"
/>

You should now be able to see the device on the TTN console after you fully register your device, as shown in **Figure 44**.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

- The **AppEUI**, **DevEUI**, and **AppKey** are the parameters that you will need to activate your LoRaWAN end-device via OTAA. The **AppKey** is hidden by default for security reasons, but you can easily show it by clicking the show button. You can also copy the parameters quickly using the copy button.
- The three OTAA parameters on the TTN device console are MSB by default. 
- These parameters are always accessible on the device console page, as shown in **Figure 45**.

##### OTAA Configuration for TTN

The RAK3172 module supports a series of AT commands to configure its internal parameters and control the functionalities of the module. 

1. To set up the RAK3172 module to join the TTN using OTAA, start by connecting the RAK3172 module to your computer (see [Figure 30](/Product-Categories/wisduo/RAK3172-Module/Quickstart/#connect-to-the-rak3172)) and open the RAK Serial Port Tool. Select the right COM port and set the baud rate to 115200.

It is recommended to start by testing the serial communication and verify that the current configuration is working by sending these two AT commands:

```
AT
```

```
ATE
```

`ATE` will echo the commands you input to the module, which is useful for tracking the commands and troubleshooting.

You will receive `OK` when you input the two commands. After setting `ATE`, you can now see all the commands you input together with the replies. Try again `AT` and you should see it on the terminal followed by `OK`, as shown in **Figure 46**.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

If there is no `OK` or any reply, you need to check if the wiring of your UART lines is correct and if the baud is correctly configured to 115200. Also, you can check if the device is powered correctly. If you are getting power from a USB port, ensure that you have a good USB cable.
:::

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/atstart.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="at+version command response"
/>


2. The next step is to configure the OTAA LoRaWAN parameters in RAK3172: 

- LoRa work mode: **LoRaWAN**
- LoRaWAN join mode: **OTAA**
- LoRaWAN class: **Class A**
- LoRaWAN region: **EU868** 

Set the work mode to LoRaWAN.

```
AT+NWM=1
```

Set the LoRaWAN activation to OTAA.

```
AT+NJM=1
```

Set the LoRaWAN class to Class A.

```
AT+CLASS=A
```

Set the frequency/region to EU868.

```
AT+BAND=4
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:

Depending on the Regional Band you selected, you might need to configure the sub-band of your RAK3172 to match the gateway and LoRaWAN network server. This is especially important for Regional Bands like US915, AU915, and CN470.

To configure the masking of channels for the sub-bands, you can use the `AT+MASK` command that can be found on the [AT Command Manual](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK3172-Module/AT-Command-Manual/#at-mask).

To illustrate, you can use sub-band 2 by sending the command `AT+MASK=0002`.
:::

**List of band parameter options**

| Code     | Regional Band |
| -------- | ------------- |
| 0        | EU433         |
| 1        | CN470         |
| 2        | RU864         |
| 3        | IN865         |
| 4        | EU868         |
| 5        | US915         |
| 6        | AU915         |
| 7        | KR920         |
| 8 or 8-1 | AS923-1       |
| 8-2      | AS923-2       |
| 8-3      | AS923-3       |
| 8-4      | AS923-4       |

  width="90%"
  caption="Configuring LoRa Parameters"
/>


3. After the configuration of the LoRaWAN parameters, the next step is to set up the EUIs and key. You need the use the values from the TTN console.

- Device EUI: **1133557799224466**
- Application EUI: **1000000000000009**
- Application Key: **04FA4E626EF5CF227C969601176275C2**


Set the Device EUI.

```
AT+DEVEUI=1133557799224466
```

Set the Application EUI.

```
AT+APPEUI=1000000000000009
```

Set the Application Key.

```
AT+APPKEY=04FA4E626EF5CF227C969601176275C2
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/otaaeuis.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="Configuring LoRa Parameters"
/>

4. After EUI and keys configuration, the device can now join the network and send payloads.

```
AT+JOIN=1:0:10:8
```
:::tip üìù NOTE:
`AT+JOIN` command parameters are optional. You can configure the settings for auto-join, reattempt interval, and the number of join attempts if your application needs it. If not configured, it will use the default parameter values.

`AT+JOIN` and `AT+JOIN=1` also share the common functionality of trying to join the network.  
:::

Join command format: **`AT+JOIN=w:x:y:z`**

| Parameter | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| w         | Join command - 1: joining, 0: stop joining.                  |
| x         | Auto-join config - 1: auto-join on power-up, 0: no auto-join |
| y         | Reattempt interval in seconds (7-255) - 8 is the default.        |
| z         | Number of join attempts (0-255) - 0 is default.              |

After 5 or 6 seconds, if the request is successfully received by a LoRa gateway, you should see `+EVT:JOINED` status reply, as shown in **Figure 49**.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

If the OTAA device failed to join, you need to check if your device is within reach of a working LoRaWAN gateway that is configured to connect to TTN. It is also important to check that all your OTAA parameters (DEVEUI, APPEUI, and APPKEY) are correct using the `AT+DEVEUI=?`, `AT+APPEUI=?`, and `AT+APPKEY=?` commands. Lastly, ensure that the antenna of your device is properly connected.

After checking all the things above, try to join again. 
:::

1. With the end-device properly activated, you can now try to send some payload after a successful join.

```
AT+SEND=2:12345678
```

6. Send command format: **`AT+SEND=<port>:<payload>`**

3. At this step, you need to put a unique **End device ID** and **DevEUI**, as shown in **Figure 54**. Check if your module has a DevEUI on the sticker or QR that you can scan then use this as the device unique DevEUI.

Optionally, you can add a more descriptive **End device name** and **End device description** about your device.

4. After putting all the details, click **Network layer settings** to proceed to the next step.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

It is advisable to use a meaningful end-device ID, end-device name, and end-device description that will match your device purpose. The end-device ID `rak-device-abp` is for illustration purposes only.

:::

##### ABP Configuration for TTN

1. To set up the RAK3172 module to join the TTN using ABP, start by connecting the RAK3172 module to the computer (see [Figure 30](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK3172-Module/Quickstart/#connect-to-the-rak3172)) and open the RAK Serial Port Tool. Select the right COM port and set the baud rate to 115200.

It is recommended to start by testing the serial communication and verify the current configuration is working by sending these two AT commands:

```
AT
```

```
ATE
```

`ATE` will echo the commands you input to the module, which is useful for tracking the commands and troubleshooting.

2. You will receive OK when you input the two commands. After setting `ATE`, you can now see all the commands you input together with the replies. Try again AT and you should see it on the terminal followed by OK, as shown in **Figure 45**.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

If there is no `OK` or any reply, you need to check if the wiring of your UART lines is correct and if the baud is correctly configured to 115200. Also, you can check if the device is powered correctly. If you are getting power from a USB port, ensure that you have a good USB cable.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

Depending on the Regional Band you selected, you might need to configure the sub-band of your RAK3172 to match the gateway and LoRaWAN network server. This is especially important on Regional Bands like US915, AU915, and CN470.

To configure the masking of channels for the sub-bands, you can use the `AT+MASK` command that can be found on the [AT Command Manual](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK3172-Module/AT-Command-Manual/#at-mask).

To illustrate, you can use sub-band 2 by sending the command `AT+MASK=0002`.

5. After EUI and keys configuration, the device can now join the network and send some payload.

```
AT+JOIN=1:0:8:0
```

Join command format: **`AT+JOIN=w:x:y:z`**


| Parameter | Description                                                  |

| x         | Auto-join config - 1: auto-join on power-up, 0: no auto-join |
| y         | Reattempt interval in seconds (7-255) - 8 is the default.    |
| z         | Number of join attempts (0-255) - 0 is default.              |


6. With the end-device properly activated, you can now try to send some payload after a successful join.

```
AT+SEND=3:12341234
```

Send command format: **`AT+SEND=<port>:<payload>`**

:::tip üìù NOTE:

If your LoRaWAN payload didn't reach the TTN, check if your device is within reach of a working LoRaWAN gateway that is configured to connect to TTN. It is also important to check that all your ABP parameters (DEVADDR, APPSKEY, and NWKSKEY) are correct by using `AT+DEVADDR=?`, `AT+APPSKEY=?`, and `AT+NWKSKEY=?` commands. Lastly, ensure that the antenna of your device is properly connected.

After checking all the things above, try to send LoRaWAN payloads again.

  width="60%"
  caption="RAK3172 Module in the Context of the ChirpStack Platform"
/>

The ChirpStack, previously known as the LoRaServer project, provides open-source components for building LoRaWAN networks. Like in the case of TTN, the RAK3172 module is located in the periphery and will transmit the data to the backend servers through a LoRa gateway. Learn more about [ChirpStack](https://www.chirpstack.io/).

:::tip üìù NOTE:

It is assumed that you are using a RAK Gateway and its built-in ChirpStack. Also, the gateway with the ChirpStack must be configured successfully. For further information, check the RAK documents for more details.

:::

* In summary, these are the requirements: 

  1. In a ChirpStack online gateway, the frequency band of the nodes should be consistent with the frequency band of the gateway in use.
      * [Connect the Gateway with Chirpstack](/Product-Categories/WisGate/RAK7243/Quickstart/#connect-the-gateway-with-chirpstack)
  2.  The RAK Serial Port Tool provided by RAK
  3.  RAK3172 module

:::tip üìù NOTE:
The frequency band used in the demonstration is EU868. Use a high-frequency version of RAK3172. The product number should be ‚Äú**RAK3172 (H)**‚Äù.
:::

##### Create a New Application

1. Log in to the ChirpStack server using your account and password.

2. Go to the Application section, as shown in **Figure 64**.

<rk-img

6. Once the node is created, fill in the necessary data. You can generate a Device EUI automatically by clicking the following icon, or you can write a correct Device EUI in the edit box.

Fill in the parameters requested:

* **Device name and Device description**: These are descriptive texts about your device. 

* **Device EUI**: This interface allows you to generate a Device EUI automatically by clicking the generate icon. You can also add a specific Device EUI directly in the form. 

* **Device Profile**: 
  * If you want to join in OTAA mode, select ‚Äú**DeviceProfile_OTAA**‚Äù.
  * If you want to join in ABP mode, select ‚Äú**DeviceProfile_ABP**‚Äù.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
Device profiles **DeviceProfile_OTAA** and **DeviceProfile_ABP** are only available if you are using the built-in Chirpstack LoRaWAN Server of RAK Gateways.

If you have your own Chirpstack installation, you can set up the device profile with `LoRaWAN MAC version 1.0.3` and `LoRaWAN Regional Parameters revision B` to make it compatible with RAK3172.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

Standard OTAA mode requires the **Device EUI**, **Application Key**, and **Application EUI**, but in the ChirpStack‚Äôs implementation, only the Device EUI and the Application Key are mandatory. The Application EUI is not required and not recorded in the Application tab. Nevertheless, you can reuse the Device EUI as the Application EUI during the configuration on the side of the node. 

:::

##### OTAA Configuration for Chirpstack

The RAK3172 module supports a series of AT commands to configure its internal parameters and control the functionalities of the module. 

1. To set up the RAK3172 module to join the Chirpstack using OTAA, start by connecting the RAK3172 module to the Computer (see [Figure 30](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK3172-Module/Quickstart/#connect-to-the-rak3172)) and open the RAK Serial Port Tool. Select the right COM port and set the baud rate to 115200.

It is recommended to start by testing the serial communication and verify that the current configuration is working by sending these two AT commands:

```
AT
```

```
ATE
```

`ATE` will echo the commands you input to the module, which is useful for tracking the commands and troubleshooting.

You will receive `OK` when you input the two commands. After setting `ATE`, you can now see all the commands you input together with the replies. Try again `AT` and you should see it on the terminal followed by `OK`, as shown in **Figure 76**.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

If there is no `OK` or any reply, you need to check if the wiring of your UART lines is correct and if the baud is correctly configured to 115200. Also, you can check if the device is powered correctly. If you are getting power from a USB port, ensure that you have a good USB cable.
:::

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/atstart.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="at+version command response"
/>


2. The next step is to configure the OTAA LoRaWAN parameters in RAK3172: 

- LoRa work mode: **LoRaWAN**
- LoRaWAN join mode: **OTAA**
- LoRaWAN class: **Class A**
- LoRaWAN region: **EU868** 

Set the work mode to LoRaWAN.

```
AT+NWM=1
```

Set the LoRaWAN activation to OTAA.

```
AT+NJM=1
```

Set the LoRaWAN class to Class A.

```
AT+CLASS=A
```

Set the frequency/region to EU868.

```
AT+BAND=4
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:

Depending on the Regional Band you selected, you might need to configure the sub-band of your RAK3172 to match the gateway and LoRaWAN network server. This is especially important for Regional Bands like US915, AU915, and CN470.

To configure the masking of channels for the sub-bands, you can use the `AT+MASK` command that can be found on the [AT Command Manual](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK3172-Module/AT-Command-Manual/#at-mask).

To illustrate, you can use sub-band 2 by sending the command `AT+MASK=0002`.
:::

**List of band parameter options**

| Code     | Regional Band |
| -------- | ------------- |
| 0        | EU433         |

| 2        | RU864         |
| 3        | IN865         |
| 4        | EU868         |

3. After the configuration of the LoRaWAN parameters, the next step is to set up the DevEUI and AppKey. You need the use the values from the Chirpstack device console. 

:::tip üìù NOTE:
The Application EUI parameter is not required in the ChirpStack platform; therefore, it is possible to use the same id as the Device EUI. 
::: 

- Device EUI: **5E9D1E0857CF25F1**
- Application EUI: **5E9D1E0857CF25F1**
- Application Key: **F921D50CD7D02EE3C5E6142154F274B2**


Set the Device EUI.

```
AT+DEVEUI=5E9D1E0857CF25F1
```

Set the Application EUI.

```
AT+APPEUI=5E9D1E0857CF25F1
```

Set the Application Key.

```
AT+APPKEY=F921D50CD7D02EE3C5E6142154F274B2
```

4. After EUI and key configuration, the device can now join the network and send some payload.

```
AT+JOIN=1:0:10:8
```
:::tip üìù NOTE:
`AT+JOIN` command parameters are optional. You can configure the settings for auto-join, reattempt interval, and the number of join attempts if your application needs it. If not configured, it will use the default parameter values.

`AT+JOIN` and `AT+JOIN=1` also share the common functionality of trying to join the network.  
:::

Join command format: **`AT+JOIN=w:x:y:z`**

| Parameter | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| w         | Join command - 1: joining, 0: stop joining.                  |
| x         | Auto-join config - 1: auto-join on power-up, 0: no auto-join |
| y         | Reattempt interval in seconds (7-255) - 8 is the default.        |
| z         | Number of join attempts (0-255) - 0 is default.              |

After 5 or 6 seconds, if the request is successfully received by a LoRa gateway, you should see the JOINED status reply.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

If the OTAA device failed to join, you need to check if your device is within reach of a working LoRaWAN gateway that is configured to connect to Chirpstack. It is also important to check that all your OTAA parameters (DEVEUI and APPKEY) are correct, using the `AT+DEVEUI=?` and `AT+APPKEY=?` commands. Lastly, ensure that the antenna of your device is properly connected.

After checking all the things above, try to join again.
:::

5. With the end-device properly activated, you can now try to send some payload after a successful join.

```
AT+SEND=2:12345678
```

Send command format: **`AT+SEND=<port>:<payload>`**

  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/chirp_otaa_send.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="OTAA Test Sample Data Sent via RAK Serial Port Tool"
/>

On the ChirpStack platform, you should see the join and uplink messages in the LORAWAN FRAMES tab, as shown in **Figure 80**. By convention, messages sent from nodes to gateways are considered as **Uplinks** while messages sent by gateways to nodes are considered as **Downlinks**.

##### Chirpstack ABP Device Registration

1. During the registration of a new device, if you select ‚Äú**DeviceProfile_ABP**‚Äù, as shown in **Figure 81**, then the ChirpStack platform will assume that this device will join the LoRaWAN network using the ABP mode. 


:::tip üìù NOTE:

Check ‚Äú**Disable counting frame verification**‚Äù. During the test, when the module is restarted, the frame counting number will also be restarted from zero. This would cause a synchronization problem with the ChirpStack server treating it as a replay attack. For the testing purpose, it is safe to disable this feature, but remember to activate it in a production environment.

/>

2. After selecting the ABP mode, the following parameters appear in the Activation tab: 

Then, you can see that there are some parameters for ABP in the **‚ÄúACTIVATION‚Äù** item:

  * **Device address**
  * **Network Session Key**
  * **Application Session Key**

3. The parameters can be generated as random numbers by the platform or can be set with user values. Once these parameters are filled in properly, the process is completed by clicking on the ‚Äú**ACTIVATE DEVICE**‚Äù button.


##### ABP Configuration for Chirpstack

1. To set up the RAK3172 module to join the Chirpstack using ABP, start by connecting the RAK3172 module to the Computer (see [Figure 30](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK3172-Module/Quickstart/#connect-to-the-rak3172)) and open the RAK Serial Port Tool. Select the right COM port and set the baud rate to 115200.

It is recommended to start by testing the serial communication and verify that the current configuration is working by sending these two AT commands:

```
AT

```
ATE
```

`ATE` will echo the commands you input to the module, which is useful for tracking the commands and troubleshooting.

You will receive `OK` when you input the two commands. After setting `ATE`, you can now see all the commands you input together with the replies. Try again `AT` and you should see it on the terminal followed by `OK`, as shown in **Figure 83**.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

If there is no `OK` or any reply, you need to check if the wiring of your UART lines is correct and if the baud is correctly configured to 115200. Also, you can check if the device is powered correctly. If you are getting power from a USB port, ensure that you have a good USB cable.

2. The next step is to configure the ABP LoRaWAN parameters in RAK3172: 

- LoRa work mode: **LoRaWAN**
- LoRaWAN join mode: **ABP**
- LoRaWAN class: **Class A**
- LoRaWAN region: **EU868** 

Set the work mode to LoRaWAN. It can be set to P2P as well but by default, the device is in LoRaWAN mode.

```
AT+NWM=1
```

Set the LoRaWAN activation to ABP.

```
AT+NJM=0
```

Set the LoRaWAN class to Class A.

```
AT+CLASS=A
```

Set the frequency/region to EU868.

```
AT+BAND=4
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:

Depending on the Regional Band you selected, you might need to configure the sub-band of your RAK3172 to match the gateway and LoRaWAN network server. This is especially important on Regional Bands like US915, AU915, and CN470.

To configure the masking of channels for the sub-bands, you can use the [AT+MASK command](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK3172-Module/AT-Command-Manual/#at-mask) that can be found on the AT Commands Manual.

To illustrate, you can use sub-band 2 by sending the command `AT+MASK=0002`.

`AT+JOIN` command parameters are optional. You can configure the settings for auto-join, reattempt interval, and the number of join attempts if your application needs it. If not configured, it will use the default parameter values.

`AT+JOIN` and `AT+JOIN=1` also share the common functionality of trying to join the network.  
:::

Join command format: **`AT+JOIN=w:x:y:z`**

| Parameter | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| w         | Join command - 1: joining, 0: stop joining.                  |
| x         | Auto-join config - 1: auto-join on power-up, 0: no auto-join |
| y         | Reattempt interval in seconds (7-255) - 8 is the default.    |
| z         | Number of join attempts (0-255) - 0 is default.              |

4. After 5 or 6 seconds, if the request is successfully received by a LoRa gateway, then you should see the JOINED status reply.

5. You can now try to send some payload after a successful join.

```
AT+SEND=2:12341234
```
Send command format: **`AT+SEND=<port>:<payload>`**

#### LoRa P2P Mode

This section will show you how to set up and connect two RAK3172 units to work in the LoRa P2P mode. The configuration of the RAK3172 units is done by connecting the two modules to a general-purpose computer using a USB-UART converter. The setup of each RAK3172 can be done separately, but testing the LoRa P2P mode will require having both units connected simultaneously. This could be done by having one computer with two USB ports or two computers with one USB port each.

It is recommended to start by testing the serial communication and verify the current configuration is working by sending these two AT commands:

```
AT
```

```
ATE
```

`ATE` will echo the commands you input to the module, which is useful for tracking the commands and troubleshooting.

You will receive `OK` when you input the two commands. After setting `ATE`, you can now see all the commands you input together with the replies.

Try again `AT` and you should see it on the terminal followed by `OK`.

1. To set up the RAK3172 to work in LoRa P2P mode, you need to input the work mode command on both RAK3172 modules.

```
AT+NWM=0
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/p2pworkmode.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="P2P Mode"
/>

:::tip üìù NOTE:

You might need to input the `ATE` command again to ensure that your succeeding commands on P2P mode echo on the terminal.

:::

For this P2P setup, the LoRa parameters are the following:

- Link frequency: **868000000&nbsp;Hz**
- Spreading factor: **7**
- Bandwidth: **125&nbsp;kHz**
- Coding Rate: 0 = **4/5**
- Preamble Length: **10**
- Power: **14&nbsp;dBm**

2. You need to input the P2P setup on both RAK3172 modules. The parameters should be exactly the same on the two modules. 

```
AT+P2P=868000000:7:125:0:10:14
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:

Refer to the [P2P Mode](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK3172-Module/AT-Command-Manual/) section of the AT command documentation to learn more about the definition of the parameters used.

  caption="Configuring P2P in both RAK3172 Module"
/>


3. To set one module as a receiver (RX), you need to set the value of the P2P receive command to 65535.

```
AT+PRECV=65535 
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:

- If the `AT+PRECV` value is set to 65534, the device will continuously listen to P2P LoRa TX packets without any timeout. This is the same as setting the device in RX mode.
- If the `AT+PRECV` value is set to 65535, the device will listen to P2P TX without a timeout. But it will stop listening once a P2P LoRa packet is received to save power.
- If the `AT+PRECV` value is 0, the device will stop listening to P2P TX data. The device is in TX mode.

:::

With one module configured as RX, the other device will be the TX.

4. You can now try to send a P2P payload.

```
AT+PSEND=11223344
```

## Miscellaneous
### Upgrading the Firmware

If you want to upgrade to the latest version of the firmware of the module, you can follow this section. The latest firmware can be found in the software section of [RAK3172 Datasheet](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK3172-Module/Datasheet/#firmware-os).

:::tip üìù NOTE:

**What if the RAK3172 module stops responding to AT commands and firmware update?**

You can recover your device by using the `.hex` file in the datasheet and upload it using STM32CubeProgrammer. The guide on updating STM32 firmware using STM32CubeProgrammer can be found in the [Learn section](/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/STM32Cube-Programmer-Guide/).

**WARNING:** Uploading the **.hex** file via STM32CubeProgrammer will erase all configured data on the device.

### Arduino Installation

Refer to [Software section](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK3172-Module/Quickstart/#software).

<!-- 

Go to [Arduino official website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and download the Arduino IDE. You can see the multiple versions available for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. Choose the correct version of Arduino IDE and download it.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/1.download-arduino.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Arduino IDE latest version"
/>

#### For Windows

::: tip üìù NOTE   
**For Windows 10 users**:   
Do **NOT** install the Arduino IDE from the Microsoft App store. Install the original Arduino IDE from the Arduino official website instead, since the Arduino app from the Microsoft App Store has problems using third-party Board Support Packages.
:::

1. Install the Arduino IDE, which you just downloaded, on your Windows PC. 

2. Click **I Agree** then **Next** to proceed.

<rk-img

/>

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/5.installing.png"
  width="45%"
  caption="Ongoing installation"
/>


After 100% progress, the Arduino IDE has been installed successfully.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/6.installation-success.png"
  width="45%"
  caption="Successful installation"
/>

#### For Linux

First, you need the check the compatibility with your system and choose between the 32-bit, 64-bit, and ARM versions of the Arduino IDE for Linux.

##### Installing via a tarball

After downloading the correct Arduino version, open a terminal, then run `ls` to check the installation file on the download folder.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/ls-arduino.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="Check the download folder"
/>


A tarball is a type of compressed folder, like a `.zip` file, commonly used to distribute software in Linux. To extract the files from the tarball, change the directory to where the downloaded tarball is, then run:

`tar xvf arduino-version.xz`

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/tar-linux.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="Tarball extract command"
/>

When the tar command finishes, run `ls` again. A folder named  **arduino-version** will be created.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/ls-tarball.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="Arduino install folder created"
/>

Change the current directory and go to the newly created folder directory. There will be a file named `install.sh` in the folder. Execute `sudo ./install.sh` to install the Arduino IDE.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/sudo-install.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="Arduino install script running"
/>

The `sudo` command temporarily elevates privileges allowing the installer to complete sensitive tasks without logging in as the root user.

#### For Mac OS X

In Mac OS X, the same as Linux, there is no installation process. It is just a process of decompression, then you can open Arduino IDE successfully.
