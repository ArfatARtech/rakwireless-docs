## Product Configuration

### Interfacing with RAK3172

RAK3172 module can be configured using AT commands via the UART interface. You need a USB to UART TTL adapter to connect the RAK3172 to your computer's USB port and a serial terminal tool. It is highly recommended to use the [RAK Serial Port Tool](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/en/LoRa/Tools) so you can easily send AT commands and view the replies from the console output.

#### Connect to the RAK3172

1. Connect the RAK3172 to the serial port of a general-purpose computer (USB port) using a USB to UART TTL adapter like [RAKDAP1](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/accessories/products/daplink-tool), as shown in Figure 1.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/RAK3172_UART_Connection.svg"
  width="55%"
  caption="RAK3172 Module Connection"
/>

2. Any serial communication tool can be used; but, it is recommended to use the [RAK Serial Port Tool](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/en/LoRa/Tools).

3. Configure the serial communication tool by selecting the proper port detected by the computer and configure the link as follows: 

 * Baud Rate: **9600 baud**
 * Data Bits: **8 bits**
 * Stop Bits: **1 stop bit**
 * Parity: **NONE**

#### Configuring RAK3172

To enable the RAK3172 module as a LoRa P2P module or a LoRaWAN end-device, the module must be configured and parameters must be set by sending AT commands.

The first step is to connect the RAK3172 module to the USB-UART converter computer as described in the previous section. Using a serial communication tool, you can now send commands to the RAK3172. For example, sending `AT` will display `OK`. For the details of all supported AT commands, refer to [AT Commands for RAK3172](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK3172-Module/AT-Command-Manual/).


### Connecting to The Things Network (TTN)

In this section, a quick tutorial guide will show how to connect the RAK3172 module to the TTN platform. 

:::tip üìù NOTE:

In this guide, you need to have a working gateway that is connected to TTN or you have to be within coverage of a TTN community network.

:::

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-evaluation-board/quickstart/4.ttn-context.png"
  width="95%"
  caption="RAK3172 EVB in the context of the TTN"
/>

As shown in Figure 2, The Things Stack (TTN V3) is an open-source LoRaWAN Network Server suitable for global, geo-distributed public and private deployments as well as for small, local networks. The architecture follows the LoRaWAN Network Reference Model for standards compliancy and interoperability. This project is actively maintained by [The Things Industries](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/).

LoRaWAN is a protocol for low-power wide-area networks. It allows for large scale Internet of Things deployments where low-powered devices efficiently communicate with Internet-connected applications over long-range wireless connections.

The RAK3172 WisDuo module can be part of this ecosystem as a device, and the objective of this section is to demonstrate how simple it is to send data to The Things Stack using the LoRaWAN protocol. To achieve this, the RAK3172 WisDuo module must be located inside the coverage of a LoRaWAN gateway connected to The Things Stack server.

#### Registration to TTN and Creating LoRaWAN Applications

The first step is to go to [The Things Network platform](https://console.cloud.thethings.network/) and select a cluster as shown on Figure 3.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/image_1.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Selecting Cluster in TTN V3"
/>

You can use the same login credentials on the TTN V2 if you have one. If you have no account yet, you need to create one.

To register as a new user to TTN, click on **Login with The Things ID** then select **register** on the next page as shown on figures 4 and 5.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/image_2.png"

  caption="Login using TTN account"
/>

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/image_3.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Registration of new account"
/>

You should now be on the step of creating your TTN account. Fill all the necessary details and activate your account.

After creating an account, you should login on the platform using your username/email and password then click **Submit** as shown on Figure 6.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/image_4.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Logging in to TTN platform"
/>

You need to click **Authorize** to proceed.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/image_5.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Authorization to TTN"

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/image_7.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Details of the TTN application"
/>

If you had no error during the previous step, you should now be on the application console page. The next step is to add end-devices to your TTN application. LoRaWAN specification enforces that each end-device has to be personalized and activated. There are two options for registering devices depending on the activation mode you select. Activation can be done either via Over-The-Air-Activation (OTAA) or Activation-By-Personalization (ABP).

#### TTN OTAA Device Registration

You need to go to your application console to be able to register a device. To start adding an OTAA end-device, you need to click **+ Add end device** as shown in Figure 10.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/image_8.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Add end device"
/>

To register the module, you need to click first **Manually** then configure the activation method by selecting **Over the air activation (OTAA)** and compatible **LoRaWAN version** then click **Start** button as shown on figures 11 and 12.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/image_9.png"

/>

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/image_10.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Device activation configuration"
/>

Then you need to put a unique **End device ID** and EUIs (**DevEUI** and **AppEUI**) as shown on Figure 13. Check if your module has a DevEUI on sticker or QR that you can scan then use this as the device unique DevEUI.

Optionally, you can add a more descriptive **End device name** and **End device description** about your device.

After putting all the details, you need to click **Network layer settings** to proceed to the next step.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

It is advisable to use a meaningful end-device ID, end-device name and end-device description that will match your device purpose. The end-device ID `rak-device` is for illustration purposes only.

:::

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/image_11.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="OTAA Device Information"
/>

The next step is to set up the **Frequency plan**, a compatible **Regional Parameter version** and the **LoRaWAN class** supported. Then you can click **Join settings**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/image_12.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="OTAA Configuration"
/>

The last step in the registration of a new OTAA end-device is the configuration of the **AppKey**. To get the AppKey, you must click the **generate button**. Then you need to click **Add end device** to finish your new device registration.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/image_13.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="OTAA AppKey generation and device registration"
/>

You should now be able to see the device on the TTN console after you fully register your device as shown in Figure 16.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

The **AppEUI**, **DevEUI** and **AppKey** are the parameters that you will need to activate your LoRaWAN end-device via OTAA. The **AppKey** is hidden by default for security reason but you can easily show it by clicking the show button. You can also copy the parameters quickly using the copy button.

The three OTAA parameters on the TTN device console are MSB by default. 

These parameters are always accessible on the device console page as shown on Figure 16.

#### OTAA Configuration for TTN

The RAK3172 module supports a series of AT commands to configure its internal parameters and control the functionalities of the module. 

To set up the RAK3172 module to join the TTN using OTAA, start by connecting the RAK3172 module to your computer (see Figure 1) and open the RAK Serial Port Tool. Select the right COM port and set the baudrate to 9600.

It is recommended to start by testing the serial communication and verify that the current configuration is working by sending these two AT commands:

```
AT
```

```
ATE
```

`ATE` will echo the commands you input to the module, which is useful for tracking the commands and troubleshooting.

You will receive `OK` when you input the two commands. After setting `ATE`, you can now see all the commands you input together with the replies. Try again `AT` and you should see it on the terminal followed by `OK` as shown in Figure 17.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

If do not receive an `OK` or any reply, you need to check if the wiring of your UART lines is correct and if the baud is correctly configured to 9600. Also you can check if the device is powered correctly. If you are getting power from USB port, ensure that you have a good USB cable.
:::

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/atstart.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="at+version command response"
/>


The next step is to configure the OTAA LoRaWAN parameters in RAK3172: 

- LoRa work mode: **LoRaWAN**
- LoRaWAN join mode: **OTAA**
- LoRaWAN class: **Class A**
- LoRaWAN region: **EU868** 

Set the work mode to LoRaWAN.

```
AT+NWM=1
```

Set the LoRaWAN activation to OTAA.

```
AT+NJM=1
```

Set the LoRaWAN class to Class A.

```
AT+CLASS=A
```

Set the frequency/region to EU868.

```
AT+BAND=4
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:

Depending on the Regional Band you selected, you might need to configure the sub-band of your RAK3172 to match the gateway and LoRaWAN network server. This is especially important for Regional Bands like US915, AU915, and CN470.

To configure the masking of channels for the sub-bands, you can use the [AT+MASK command that can be found on the AT Commands Manual](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK3172-Module/AT-Command-Manual/#at-mask).

To illustrate, you can use use sub-band 2 by sending the command `AT+MASK=0002`.
:::

**List of band parameter options**

| Code  | Regional Band |
| ----- | ------------- |
| 0     | EU433         |
| 1     | CN470         |
| 2     | RU864         |
| 3     | IN865         |

After configuration of the LoRaWAN parameters, the next step is to set up the EUIs and key. You need the use the values from the TTN console.

- Device EUI: **1133557799224466**
- Application EUI: **1000000000000009**
- Application Key: **04FA4E626EF5CF227C969601176275C2**


Set the Device EUI.

```
AT+DEVEUI=1133557799224466
```

Set the Application EUI.

```
AT+APPEUI=1000000000000009
```

Set the Application Key.

```
AT+APPKEY=04FA4E626EF5CF227C969601176275C2
```

  width="90%"
  caption="Configuring LoRa Parameters"
/>

After EUI and keys configuration, the device can now join the network and send payloads.

```
AT+JOIN=1:0:10:8
```

Join command format: **`AT+JOIN=w:x:y:z`**

| Parameter | Description                                                 |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| w         | Join command - 1: joining, 0: stop joining.                 |
| x         | Auto-join config - 1: auto-join on powerup, 0: no auto-join |
| y         | Reattempt interval in seconds (7-255) - 8 is default.       |
| z         | Number of join attempts (0-255) - 0 is default.             |

After 5 or 6 seconds, if the request was successfully received by a LoRa gateway, you should see `+EVT:JOINED` status reply as shown on Figure 20.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

If the OTAA device failed to join, you need to check if your device is within reach of a working LoRaWAN gateway that is configured to connect to TTN. It is also important to check that all your OTAA parameters (DEVEUI, APPEUI and APPKEY) are correct using the `AT+DEVEUI=?`, `AT+APPEUI=?` and `AT+APPKEY=?` commands. Lastly, ensure that the antenna of your device is properly connected.

After checking all the things above, try to join again. 
:::

With the end-device properly activated, you can now try to send some payload after a successful join.

```
AT+SEND=2:12345678
```
Send command format: **`AT+SEND=<port>:<payload>`**

  width="60%"
  caption="RAK3172 Module in the Context of the ChirpStack Platform"
/>

The ChirpStack, previously known as the LoRaServer project, provides open-source components for building LoRaWAN networks. Like in the case of TTN, the RAK3172 module is located in the periphery and will transmit the data to the backend servers through a LoRa gateway. Learn more about [ChirpStack](https://www.chirpstack.io/).

:::tip üìù NOTE:

It is assumed that you are using a RAK Gateway and its built-in ChirpStack. Also, the gateway with the ChirpStack must be configured successfully. For further information, check the RAK documents for more details.

:::

* In summary, these are the requirements: 

  1. A ChirpStack online gateway, the frequency band of the nodes should be consistent with the frequency band of the gateway in use.
      *	[Connect the Gateway with Chirpstack](/Product-Categories/WisGate/RAK7243/Quickstart/#connect-the-gateway-with-chirpstack)
  2.	The RAK Serial Port Tool provided by RAK
  3.	RAK3172 module

:::tip üìù NOTE:
The frequency band used in the demonstration is EU868. Use a high-frequency version of RAK3172. The product number should be ‚Äú**RAK3172 (H)**‚Äù.
:::

#### Create a New Application

Login to the ChirpStack server using your account and password.

Go to the Application section as shown in the Figure 35.

<rk-img

:::tip üìù NOTE:

Standard OTAA mode requires the **Device EUI**, **Application Key**, and **Application EUI**, but in the ChirpStack‚Äôs implementation, only the Device EUI and the Application Key are mandatory. The Application EUI is not required and not recorded in the Application tab. Nevertheless, you can reuse the Device EUI as the Application EUI during the configuration in the side of the node. 

:::

#### OTAA Configuration for Chirpstack

The RAK3172 module supports a series of AT commands to configure its internal parameters and control the functionalities of the module. 

To set up the RAK3172 module to join the Chirpstack using OTAA, start by connecting the RAK3172 module to the Computer (see Figure 1) and open the RAK Serial Port Tool. Select the right COM port and set baudrate to 9600.

It is recommended to start by testing the serial communication and verify that the current configuration is working by sending these two AT commands:

```
AT
```

```
ATE
```

`ATE` will echo the commands you input to the module, which is useful for tracking the commands and troubleshooting.

You will receive `OK` when you input the two commands. After setting `ATE`, you can now see all the commands you input together with the replies. Try again `AT` and you should see it on the terminal followed by `OK` as shown on Figure 47.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

If do not receive an `OK` or any reply, you need to check if the wiring of your UART lines is correct and if the baud is correctly configured to 9600. Also you can check if the device is powered correctly. If you are getting power from USB port, ensure that you have a good USB cable.
:::

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-module/quickstart/atstart.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="at+version command response"
/>


The next step is to configure the OTAA LoRaWAN parameters in RAK3172: 

- LoRa work mode: **LoRaWAN**
- LoRaWAN join mode: **OTAA**
- LoRaWAN class: **Class A**
- LoRaWAN region: **EU868** 

Set the work mode to LoRaWAN.

```
AT+NWM=1
```

Set the LoRaWAN activation to OTAA.

```
AT+NJM=1
```

Set the LoRaWAN class to Class A.

```
AT+CLASS=A
```

Set the frequency/region to EU868.

```
AT+BAND=4
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:

Depending on the Regional Band you selected, you might need to configure the sub-band of your RAK3172 to match the gateway and LoRaWAN network server. This is specially important for Regional Bands like US915, AU915, and CN470.

To configure the masking of channels for the sub-bands, you can use the [AT+MASK command that can be found on the AT Commands Manual](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK3172-Module/AT-Command-Manual/#at-mask).

To illustrate, you can use use sub-band 2 by sending the command `AT+MASK=0002`.
:::

**List of band parameter options**

| Code  | Regional Band |
| ----- | ------------- |
| 0     | EU433         |
| 1     | CN470         |
| 2     | RU864         |
| 3     | IN865         |
| 4     | EU868         |
| 5     | US915         |
| 6     | AU915         |
| 7     | KR920         |
| 8 or 8-1     | AS923-1         |
| 8-2   | AS923-2       |

After configuration of the LoRaWAN parameters, the next step is to set up the DevEUI and AppKey. You need the use the values from the Chirpstack device console. 

:::tip üìù NOTE:
The Application EUI parameter is not required in the ChirpStack platform; therefore, it possible to use the same id as the Device EUI. 
::: 

- Device EUI: **5E9D1E0857CF25F1**
- Application EUI: **5E9D1E0857CF25F1**
- Application Key: **F921D50CD7D02EE3C5E6142154F274B2**


Set the Device EUI.

```
AT+DEVEUI=5E9D1E0857CF25F1
```

Set the Application EUI.

```
AT+APPEUI=5E9D1E0857CF25F1
```

Set the Application Key.

```
AT+APPKEY=F921D50CD7D02EE3C5E6142154F274B2
```

After EUI and key configuration, the device can now join the network and send some payload.

```
AT+JOIN=1:0:10:8
```

Join command format: **`AT+JOIN=w:x:y:z`**

| Parameter | Description                                                 |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| w         | Join command - 1: joining, 0: stop joining.                 |
| x         | Auto-join config - 1: auto-join on powerup, 0: no auto-join |
| y         | Reattempt interval in seconds (7-255) - 8 is default.       |
| z         | Number of join attempts (0-255) - 0 is default.             |

After 5 or 6 seconds, if the request was successfully received by a LoRa gateway, you should see the JOINED status reply.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

If the OTAA device failed to join, you need to check if your device is within reach of a working LoRaWAN gateway that is configured to connect to Chirpstack. It is also important to check that all your OTAA parameters (DEVEUI and APPKEY) are correct, using the `AT+DEVEUI=?` and `AT+APPKEY=?` commands. Lastly, ensure that the antenna of your device is properly connected.

After checking all the things above, try to join again.
:::

With the end-device properly activated, you can now try to send some payload after a successful join.

```
AT+SEND=2:12345678
```
Send command format: **`AT+SEND=<port>:<payload>`**

/>

On the ChirpStack platform, you should see the join and uplink messages in the LORAWAN FRAMES tab as shown in Figure 51. By convention, messages sent from nodes to gateways are considered as **Uplinks** while messages sent by gateways to nodes are considered as **Downlinks**.

#### Chirpstack ABP Device Registration

During the registration of a new device, if you select ‚Äú**DeviceProfile_ABP**‚Äù, as shown in Figure 52, then the ChirpStack platform will assume that this device will join to the LoRaWAN network using the ABP mode. 


:::tip üìù NOTE:

Check ‚Äú**Disable counting frame verification**‚Äù. During the test, when the module is restarted, the frame counting number will be also be restarted from zero. This would cause a synchronization problem with the ChirpStack server treating it as a replay attack. For the testing purpose, it is safe to disable this feature, but remember to activate it in a production environment.

### LoRa P2P Mode

This section will show you how to set up and connect two RAK3172 units to work in the LoRa P2P mode. The configuration of the RAK3172 units are done by connecting the two modules to a general-purpose computer using a USB-UART converter. The setup of each RAK3172 can be done separately, but testing the LoRa P2P mode will require having both units connected simultaneously. This could be done by having one computer with two USB ports or two computers with one USB port each.

It is recommended to start by testing the serial communication and verify the current configuration is working by sending these two AT commands:

```
AT
```

```
ATE
```

`ATE` will echo the commands you input to the module, which is useful for tracking the commands and troubleshooting.

You will receive `OK` when you input the two commands. After setting `ATE`, you can now see all the commands you input together with the replies.

Try again `AT` and you should see it on the terminal followed by `OK`.

To setup the RAK3172 to work in LoRa P2P mode, you need to input the work mode command on both RAK3172 modules.

```
AT+NWM=0
```

<rk-img

  width="90%"
  caption="P2P Mode"
/>

:::tip üìù NOTE:

You might need to input `ATE` command again to ensure that your succeeding commands on P2P mode echo on the terminal.

:::

For this P2P setup, the LoRa parameters are the following:

- Link frequency: **868000000&nbsp;Hz**
- Spreading factor: **7**
- Bandwidth: **125&nbsp;kHz**
- Coding Rate: 0 = **4/5**
- Preamble Length: **10**
- Power: **14&nbsp;dBm**

We need to input the P2P setup on both RAK3172 modules. The parameters should be exactly the same on the two modules. 

```
AT+P2P=868000000:7:125:0:10:14
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:

Refer to the [P2P Mode](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK3172-Module/AT-Command-Manual/) section of the AT command documentation to learn more about the definition of the parameters used.

- If AT+PRECV value is set to 65534, the device will continuously listen to P2P LoRa TX packets without any timeout. This is the same as setting the device in RX mode.
- If AT+PRECV value is set to 65535, the device will listen to P2P TX without a timeout. But it will stop listening once a P2P LoRa packet is received to save power.
- If AT+PRECV value is 0, the device will stop listening to P2P TX data. The device is in TX mode.

:::

With one module configured as RX, the other device will be the TX.

You can now try to send a P2P payload.

AT+PSEND=11223344
