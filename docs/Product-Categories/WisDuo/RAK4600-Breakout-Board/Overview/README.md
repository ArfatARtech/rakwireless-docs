## Product Description

**RAK4600 Breakout Board** is specifically designed to allow easy access to the pins on the board to simplify development and testing. The breakout board is based on the **XBee form factor**, and its main purpose is to allow the RAK4600 stamp module form factor pinout to be transferred to 2.54&nbsp;mm headers.

The board itself has the RAK4600 at its core, integrating an **nRF52832 MCU** and an **SX1276 LoRa chip**. It has Ultra-Low Power Consumption of 13.3&nbsp;Î¼A (down to 11.2&nbsp;Î¼A @ 2.0&nbsp;V) in sleep mode, high LoRa max output power (20&nbsp;dBm) in work mode, and BLE output power up to 4&nbsp;dBm.

The board complies with **LoRaWAN 1.0.2 specification**. It also supports Lora P2P Point-to-Point communication.

The RF communication capabilities of the board (LoRa + BLE) make it suitable for a variety of applications in the IoT field, such as home automation, sensor networks, building automation, and personal area networks applications (health/fitness sensors and monitors).
