# RAK15000 Quick Start Guide

## Prerequisite

### What Do You Need?

Before going through each and every step on using the RAK15000 WisBlock module, make sure to prepare the necessary items listed below:

#### Hardware

- [RAK15000 WisBlock EEPROM Module](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/wisblock-eeprom-module-rak15000?utm_source=WisBlockRAK15000&utm_medium=Document&utm_campaign=BuyFromStore)
- Your choice of [WisBlock Base](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-base)
- Your choice of [WisBlock Core](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-core)
- USB Cable
- [Li-Ion/LiPo battery (optional)](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-accessory/products/battery-connector-cable?utm_source=BatteryConnector&utm_medium=Document&utm_campaign=BuyFromStore)
- [Solar charger (optional)](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-accessory/products/solar-panel-connector-cable?utm_source=SolarPanelConnector&utm_medium=Document&utm_campaign=BuyFromStore)

#### Software

- Download and install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
- To add the RAKwireless Core boards on your Arduino Boards Manager, install the [RAKwireless Arduino BSP](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index).

## Product Configuration

### Hardware Setup

WisBlock can integrate this module which makes it easy for you to save a lot of data, making it readily available to applications that need to access it frequently. The RAK15000 EEPROM Memory module has 1,000,000 write cycles, so it can be used to store constantly changing data.

For more information about RAK15000, please refer to the [Datasheet](../Datasheet/).

The RAK15000 module can be connected to any slot of WisBlock Base to communicate with the WisBlock Core. It will work on **SLOT A, B, C, or D**. Also, always secure the connection of the WisBlock module by using compatible screws.

#### Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules

##### Assembling

As shown in **Figure 2**, the location for Slot A, B, C, and D are properly marked by silkscreen. Follow carefully the procedure defined in [RAK5005-O module assembly/disassembly instructions](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK5005-O-Baseboard-Installation-Guide/) to attach a WisBlock module. Once attached, carefully fix the module with one or more M1.2 x 3&nbsp;mm screws, depending on the module.

  caption="Sensor connection to WisBlock Base"
/>

##### Disassembling

The procedure in disassembling any type of WisBlock modules is the same.

1. First, remove the screws.

  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak15000/quickstart/removing-screws.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Removing screws from the WisBlock module"
/>

2. Once the screws are removed, check the silkscreen of the module to find the correct location where force can be applied.

  width="70%"
  caption="Detaching silkscreen on the WisBlock module"

3. Apply force to the module at the position of the connector, as shown in **Figure 5**, to detach the module from the baseboard.

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you will connect other modules to the remaining WisBlock Base slots, check on the [WisBlock Pin Mapper](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Pin-Mapper/) tool for possible conflicts. RAK15000 uses I2C communication lines, and it can cause possible conflict especially on some IO modules. For instance, if you are planning to use it in conjunction with the [EPD module](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/wisblock-epd-module-rak14000?utm_source=WisBlockRAK14000&utm_medium=Document&utm_campaign=BuyFromStore), which uses all IO pins, you would have to forego the 3-key keypad (uses IO 3, 5 and 6) and put the EEPROM module on slot D (has IO 5 & 6).
:::

After all this setup, you can now connect the battery (optional) and USB cable to start programming your WisBlock Core.

### Software Configuration and Example

The RAK15000 EEPROM has an I2C-Compatible (Two-Wire) Serial Interface. Furthermore, the EEPROM is organized in so-called pages. One page holds 256-byte and there are 1024 pages. Having insight into how the memory cells are organized is important for write and erase operations.

These are the quick links that go directly to the software guide for the specific WisBlock Core module you use:
