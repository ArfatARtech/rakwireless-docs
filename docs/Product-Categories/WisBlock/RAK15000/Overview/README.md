## Product Description

The RAK15000 WisBlock EEPROM module, part of the RAKwireless Wisblock series, is a serial EEPROM module with an I2C interface. Designed to work at low-power mode, the standby average consumption is lower than 3&nbsp;¬µA (VCC = 5.5&nbsp;V). The RAK15000 uses Microchip AT24CM02, which provides 2,097,152 bits of Serial Electrically Erasable and Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM), organized as 262,144 words of 8 bits each.

## Product Features

* 3.3&nbsp;V input voltage, on/off control by the WisBlock Core module
* **Temperature range:** -40&nbsp;¬∞C to +85&nbsp;¬∞C
* Internally organized as 262,144 x 8&nbsp;bit (2&nbsp;Mbit)
* I2C-Compatible (2-wire) Serial Interface
    - 100&nbsp;kHz Standard mode
    - 400&nbsp;kHz Fast Mode
* High Reliability
    - Endurance: 1,000,000 write cycles
    - Data retention: 100 years
* Built in error detection and correction
* 256-byte Page Write Mode
* Random and Sequential Read Modes
* Standby current less than 3&nbsp;¬µA
* **Module size**: 10 x 10&nbsp;mm

## Prerequisites

To use a **RAK15000**, you need at least a **WisBlock Base** to plug the module in. **WisBlock Base** is the power supply for the **RAK15000** module. Furthermore, you need a **WisBlock Core** module to access the EEPROM memory.
