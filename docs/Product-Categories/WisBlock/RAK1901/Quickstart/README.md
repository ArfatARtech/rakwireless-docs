# RAK1901 Quick Start Guide

<!--
## Introduction

This guide introduces the WisBlock Sensor RAK1901 Temp & Humidity board and how to program with it.

The information obtained from the SHTC3 sensor will then be printed over the USB debug port of the WisBlock Base board.

-->

## Prerequisite

### What Do You Need?

Before going through each and every step on using RAK1901 WisBlock module, make sure to prepare the necessary items listed below:

#### Hardware

- [RAK1901 WisBlock Temperature & Humidity Sensor](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-sensor/products/rak1901-shtc3-temperature-humidity-sensor)
- Your choice of [WisBlock Base](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-base) 
- Your choice of [WisBlock Core](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-core)
- USB Cable
- [Li-Ion/LiPo battery (optional)](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-accessory/products/battery-connector-cable)
- [Solar charger (optional)](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-accessory/products/solar-panel-connector-cable)

#### Software

##### Arduino

- Download and install [ArduinoIDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
- To add the RAKwireless Core boards on your Arduino Boards Manager, install the [RAKwireless Arduino BSP](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index).

## Product Configuration

### Hardware Setup

WisBlock can integrate this module which makes it easy to build up an environmental temperature and humidity data acquisition system. 

For more information about RAK1901, refer to the [Datasheet](../Datasheet/).

The RAK1901 module gives information about:

- Environment Temperature
- Environment Humidity

RAK1901 module can be connected to any slot of WisBlock Base to communicate with the WisBlock Core. It will work on **SLOT A to D**. Also, always secure the connection of the WisBlock module by using the compatible screws.

#### Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules

##### Assembling

As shown in **Figure 2**, the location for Slot A, B, C, and D are properly marked by silkscreen. Follow carefully the procedure defined in [RAK5005-O module assembly/disassembly instructions](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK5005-O-Baseboard-Installation-Guide/) to attach a WisBlock module. Once attached, carefully fix the module with one or more pieces of M1.2 x 3&nbsp;mm screws depending on the module.

  width="70%"
  caption="RAK1901 connection to WisBlock Base"
/>

##### Disassembling

The procedure in disassembling any type of WisBlock modules is the same. 

1. First, remove the screws.

  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak1901/quickstart/removing-screws.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Removing screws from the WisBlock module"
/>

2. Once the screws are removed, check the silkscreen of the module to find the correct location where force can be applied.

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you will connect other modules to the remaining WisBlock Base slots, check on the [WisBlock Pin Mapper](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Pin-Mapper/) tool for possible conflicts. RAK1901 uses I2C communication lines, and it can cause possible conflict especially on some IO modules. 
:::


After all this setup, you can now connect the battery and USB cable to start programming your WisBlock Core.

### Software Configuration and Example

The RAK1901 is a Temperature & Humidity sensor board that contains the SHTC3 chip. The SHTC3 is a digital temperature and humidity sensor designed especially for battery-driven high-volume consumer electronics applications. The device comprises a sensing element and an IC interface which communicates through I2C from the sensing element to the application.
