## Prerequisite

### What Do You Need?

Before going through each and every step on using the RAK12005 WisBlock module, make sure to prepare the necessary items listed below:

#### Hardware 

- [RAK12005 & RAK12030 WisBlock Rain Sensor Module](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rain-sensor-rak12005-module-and-rak12030-sensor?_pos=1&_sid=a90925657&_ss=r)

- Your choice of [WisBlock Core](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-core)
- USB Cable
- [Li-Ion/LiPo battery (optional)](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-accessory/products/battery-connector-cable)
- [Solar charger (optional)](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-accessory/products/solar-panel-connector-cable)

#### Software 

##### Arduino

- You need to download and install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
- To add the RAKwireless Core boards on your Arduino Boards Manager, install the [RAKwireless Arduino BSP](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index).

## Product Configuration

### Hardware Setup

The RAK12005 is an electroconductive-liquid detect module used for detecting water and other electroconductive liquids. WisBlock can integrate this module, which makes it easy to build up a data acquisition system to help protect your assets from rain or fog damage.

For more information about RAK12005, refer to the [Datasheet](../Datasheet/).

The RAK12005 module gives information about:

- Rain/Water Detect - measures resistance changes caused by water or condensed fog.

#### RAK12030 Sensing Pad

The sensor contains a sensing pad that you can place the sensor exposed under the open sky where it can be affected by rainfall and keep your WisBlock solution in a dry place or inside a waterproof enclosure.

  width="30%"
  caption="RAK12030 Module"
/>

#### RAK12005 Sensor Module

The RAK12005 module produces an output voltage depending on the resistance of the sensing pad. The signal from the sensing pad is fed to an MCP606 Comparator to digitize it then the comparator output is tied to the IO pin on the WisConnector. The module also has a built-in potentiometer for sensitivity adjustment of the digital output. Keep the RAK12005 in a dry place or inside a waterproof enclosure, just make sure not to wet this part of the module.

#### Installation

##### Mounting Mechanism

The RAK12005 module can be mounted on the IO slot of the WisBlock Base board, as shown in **Figure 4**. Also, always secure the connection of the WisBlock module by using compatible screws.

  width="60%"
  caption="RAK12005 mounting connection to WisBlock Base module"
/>

##### Disassembling Procedure

The procedure in disassembling any type of WisBlock modules is the same. 

1. First, remove the screws.  

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak12005/quickstart/removing_screw.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Removing screws from the WisBlock module"
/>

2. Once the screws are removed, check the silkscreen of the module to find the correct location where force can be applied.

  width="70%"
  caption="Detaching silkscreen on the WisBlock module"

3. Apply force to the module at the position of the connector, as shown in **Figure 7**, to detach the module from the baseboard.

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you will connect other modules to the remaining WisBlock Base slots, check on the [WisBlock Pin Mapper](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Pin-Mapper/) tool for possible conflicts.
:::

Now, you can connect the battery (optional) and USB cable to start programming your WisBlock Core.

### Software Configuration and Example

In our example, you will be using the RAK12005 and RAK12030 sensors for detecting water or rain.

For RAK12005, the accessible pin assignments are defined as follows in the Arduino IDE:

- `WB_IO6` for Water Sensor Input pin

These are the quick links that go directly to the software guide for the specific WisBlock Core module you use:

2. Next, copy the following sample code into your Arduino IDE.

```c
/**

 */
#define SENSOR_PIN  WB_IO6   // Attach Water sensor to Arduino Digital Pin WB_IO6

void setup() 
{
   pinMode(SENSOR_PIN, INPUT);   // The Water Sensor is an Input
   pinMode(LED_GREEN, OUTPUT);  // The LED is an Output
   pinMode(LED_BLUE, OUTPUT);   // The LED is an Output
}
void loop() 
{

   /* The water sensor will switch HIGH when water is detected.
    when water is detected turn LED on, and switch off when no water is present */
   if( digitalRead(SENSOR_PIN) == HIGH) 
   {
      digitalWrite(LED_GREEN,HIGH);   //turn on
      digitalWrite(LED_BLUE,HIGH);
   }else 
   {
      digitalWrite(LED_GREEN,LOW);
      digitalWrite(LED_BLUE,LOW);
   }
}

```

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you experience any error in compiling the example sketch, check the updated code for your WisBlock Core Module that can be found on the [RAK12005 WisBlock Example Code Repository](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/tree/master/examples/common/IO/RAK12005_WaterDetector).

4. When you successfully uploaded the example sketch, you'll now be able to test the RAK12005 Rain Sensor module. Try pouring water on the copper traces of the RAK12030 and you'll be able to see that the blue and green LED of the WisBlock solution lights up when there is a presence of water, and then switched off when there is no presence of water or dry.
