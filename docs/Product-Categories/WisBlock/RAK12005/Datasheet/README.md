# RAK12005 WisBlock Rain Sensor Module Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

The RAK12005, a part of WisBlock Sensor, is an electroconductive-liquid detect module used for detecting water and other electroconductive liquids. If the detection area is wet, the output of Microchip's MCP606 CMOS op-amp will go positive, signaling the presence of liquid.

RAK12005 WisBlock Rain Sensor Module also has a separate sensor PCB, the RAK12030. This sensor PCB is connected to the RAK12005 with a cable so that you can place the sensor under the open sky and keep your WisBlock solution in a dry place or inside a waterproof enclosure.

#### Schematic Diagram

**Figure 6** shows the RAK12005 water module schematic. The MCP606 acts as a comparator on this module, the resistor divider (made of R7 and R5) is used as a voltage reference, and J2 is a water detect panel connector. 

The second divider consists of resistor R4 and a water detect panel connector (J2). When the water detect panel is dry, its resistance is near-infinite, and the voltage applied to the inverting terminal of the comparator equals VCC (3.3V). 

Since the voltage of the reference divider connected to the non-inverting input is VCC/2, the output of the comparator is at zero voltage. Once the liquid is present at the detect panel, its resistance drops and pulls the voltage on the inverting input of the comparator toward zero volts. Once this voltage falls below VCC/2, the comparator output swings toward VCC, signaling the presence of liquid. Then the comparator output is tied to the IO pin on the WisConnector.
