## Product Description

The RAK12005, a part of WisBlock Sensor, is an electroconductive-liquid detect module used for detecting water and other electroconductive liquids. If the detection area is wet, the output of Microchip's MCP606 CMOS op-amp will go positive, signaling the presence of liquid.

RAK12005 WisBlock Rain Sensor Module also has a separate sensor PCB, the RAK12030. This sensor PCB is connected to the RAK12005 with a cable so that you can place the sensor under the open sky and keep your WisBlock solution in a dry place or inside a waterproof enclosure.
