# RAK2305 Quick Start Guide

## Prerequisites

### What Do You Need?

Before going through each and every step on using the RAK2305 WisBlock module, make sure to prepare the necessary items listed below:

#### Hardware

- [RAK2305 WisBlock Wireless Module](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak2305-wi-fi-extension-board?utm_source=RAK2305&utm_medium=Document&utm_campaign=BuyFromStore)
- Your choice of [WisBlock Base](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-base)
- Your choice of [WisBlock Core](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-core)
- USB Cable
- [Li-Ion/LiPo battery (optional)](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-accessory/products/battery-connector-cable?utm_source=BatteryConnector&utm_medium=Document&utm_campaign=BuyFromStore)
- [Solar charger (optional)](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-accessory/products/solar-panel-connector-cable?utm_source=SolarPanelConnector&utm_medium=Document&utm_campaign=BuyFromStore)
- [USB to UART TTL adapter](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/daplink-tool?utm_source=RAKDAP1&utm_medium=Document&utm_campaign=BuyFromStore)(to flash image)
- Jumper (to flash image)

#### Software

##### ESP-AT project

ESP-AT is a project developed by Espressif to integrate connectivity into customers‚Äô products. It aims to reduce software development costs and allows you to create new products quickly. AT is the abbreviation for Attention. These commands come from Hayes commands that were used by the Hayes smart modems.

ESP-AT is based on ESP-IDF, the official development framework for the ESP32. On this solution, a WisBlock Core works as an Initiator and the WisBlock Wireless RAK2305 is the target. The initiator sends AT commands via UART to the target and receives AT responses back. The AT commands are processed on target one by one. Therefore, you should wait for the previous command to be executed before sending out the next one. You can develop your own AT commands based on the ESP-AT project and implement more features according to your needs. Check the [Low Level Development](../Low-Level-Development/) section.

Two RAK2305 ESP-AT firmware versions are available:
- [RAK2305-Basic-WIFI-BLE-AT.bin](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/blob/master/bootloader/RAK2305/RAK2305-Basic-WIFI-BLE-AT.bin)ÔºöThe Factory bin version with WiFi and BLE AT commands. This is the default firmware uploaded to the RAK2305.
- [RAK2305-Basic-WIFI-HTTP-MQTT-AT.bin](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/blob/master/bootloader/RAK2305/RAK2305-Basic-WIFI-HTTP-MQTT-AT.bin): With WiFi, MQTT and HTTP AT Commands. If you want to use the MQTT and HTTP AT Commands, this firmware is needed.

## Product Configuration

### Hardware Setup

RAK2305 WisBlock WiFi Interface Module can only be connected with WisBlock Base Board through the **IO SLOT**. The **IO SLOT** is used by the RAK2305 to communicate with the WisBlock Core. Also, always secure the connection of the WisBlock module by using the compatible screws.

For more information about the RAK2305, refer to the [Datasheet](../Datasheet/).

#### Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules

##### Assembling

There is only a single **IO SLOT** in the WisBlock Base Board to connect the RAK2305. As shown in **Figure 2**, the location of the slot is properly marked by silkscreen. Follow carefully the procedure defined in [RAK5005-O module assembly/disassembly instructions](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK5005-O-Baseboard-Installation-Guide/) to attach a WisBlock module. Once attached, fix the module with three pieces of M1.2 x 3&nbsp;mm screws.

  width="80%"
  caption="RAK2305 connection to WisBlock Base Board"

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you will connect other modules to the remaining WisBlock Base slots, check on the [WisBlock Pin Mapper](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Pin-Mapper/) tool for possible conflicts. RAK2305 uses UART communication lines on the **IO SLOT**.
:::

After all this setup, you can now connect the battery (optional) and USB cable to start programming your WisBlock.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

- Battery can cause harm if not handled properly.
- Only 3.7-4.2&nbsp;V Rechargeable LiPo batteries are supported. It is highly recommended not to use other types of batteries with the system unless you know what you are doing.
- If a non-rechargeable battery is used, it has to be unplugged first before connecting the USB cable to the USB port of the board to configure the device. Not doing so might damage the battery or cause fire.
- Make sure the battery wires match the polarity on the RAK WisBlock Base Board. Not all batteries have the same wiring.
- Only 5&nbsp;V solar panels are supported. Do not use 12&nbsp;V solar panels. It will destroy the charging unit and eventually other electronic parts.
:::

##### Disassembling

1. First, remove the screws.

2. Once the screws are removed, check the silkscreen of the module to find the correct location where force can be applied. By applying even force under the marked area, the module can be detached from the baseboard.

3. Apply force to the module at the position of the connector, as shown in **Figure 4**, to detach the module from the baseboard.

### Software Configuration and Examples

RAK2305 has a default firmware loaded in it that supports WiFi and BLE related AT Commands. If you need to have HTTP or MQTT functionality, you need to upload a different [firmware](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/blob/master/bootloader/RAK2305/RAK2305-Basic-WIFI-HTTP-MQTT-AT.bin) that supports those features.

The complete list of ESP32 AT Command set can be found in the [Espressif AT Command Set online documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-at/en/latest/AT_Command_Set/index.html).


#### Initial Test of the RAK2305 WisBlock Wireless

The AT commands start with **`AT`** and end with a new line **`(CR LF)`** and the default baud rate of AT Command UART is 115200.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
Make sure to use the **`setup()`** function with timeout.
:::

```c
void setup()
{
    time_t timeout = millis();
    // Open serial communications and wait for port to open:
    Serial.begin(115200);
    while (!Serial)
    {
        if ((millis() - timeout) < 5000)
        {
            delay(100);
        }
        else
        {
            break;
        }
    }
```

1. First, you need to select the WisBlock Core you have.

Selecting RAK4631 as WisBlock Core.

#### Examples

For **RAK4631 WisBlock Core**:


  * [ESP-AT Command Test](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/tree/master/examples/RAK4630/communications/WiFi/AT_Command_Test) - This example waits for an AT command typed at the console. Then sends that command to RAK2305 and wait for reply.
  * [Connect to Access Point](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/tree/master/examples/RAK4630/communications/WiFi/connect_ap) - This example connects to a known access point and send ping to the address "8.8.8.8" every 5 seconds.

For **RAK11310 WisBlock Core**:

  * [ESP-AT Command Test](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/tree/master/examples/RAK11300/communications/WiFi/connect_ap) - This example waits for an AT command typed at the console then sends that command to RAK2305 and wait for reply.
  * [Connect to Access Point](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/tree/master/examples/RAK11300/communications/WiFi/connect_ap) - This example connects to a known access point and send ping to the address "8.8.8.8" every 5 seconds.
