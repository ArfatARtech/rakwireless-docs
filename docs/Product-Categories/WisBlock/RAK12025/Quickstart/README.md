# RAK12025 Quick Start Guide

## Prerequisite

### What Do You Need?

Before going through each and every step on using the RAK12025 WisBlock Module, make sure to prepare the necessary items listed below:

#### Hardware

- [RAK12025](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak12025-gyroscope-sensor-module)
- Your choice of [WisBlock Base](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-base) 
- Your choice of [WisBlock Core](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-core)
- USB Cable
- Li-Ion/Li-Po battery (optional)
- Solar charger (optional)

#### Software

- Download and install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
- To add the RAKwireless Core boards on your Arduino board, install the RAKwireless Arduino BSP. Follow the steps in the [Github repo](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index).

## Product Configuration

### Hardware Setup

WisBlock can integrate this module which extends the WisBlock system with a gyroscope sensor. 

For more information about RAK12025, refer to the [Datasheet](../Datasheet/).

The RAK12025 module gives us information about:

- Selectable full scale (245/500/2000&nbsp;dps)
- I2C interface
- 16-bit rate value data output
- 8-bit temperature data output 

This can be mounted to the sensor slot of the WisBlock Base board. **Figure 1** shows the mounting mechanism of the RAK12025 on a WisBlock Base board module, such as the RAK5005-O.

::: tip üìù NOTE
RAK12025 has two digital output lines, so you need two GPIOs from WisCore. It means RAK12025 should be used on a sensor slot with two available GPIOs. However, WB_IO2 is used to control 3V3_S. Hence, RAK12025 is used only on slots without WB_IO2 like sensor slots C and D on RAK5005-O.

#### Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules

##### Assembling

As shown in **Figure 2**, the location for Slot A, B, C, and D are properly marked by silkscreen. Follow carefully the procedure defined in [RAK5005-O module assembly/disassembly instructions](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK5005-O-Baseboard-Installation-Guide/) to attach a WisBlock module. Once attached, carefully fix the module with one or more pieces of M1.2 x 3&nbsp;mm screws depending on the module.

/>

##### Disassembling

The procedure in disassembling any type of WisBlock modules is the same. 

1. First, remove the screws.

2. Once the screws are removed, check the silkscreen of the module to find the correct location where force can be applied.

3. Apply force to the module at the position of the connector, as shown in **Figure 5**, to detach the module from the baseboard.

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you will connect other modules to the remaining WisBlock Base slots, check on the [WisBlock Pin Mapper](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Pin-Mapper/) tool for possible conflicts. RAK12025 uses I2C communication lines, and it can cause possible conflict, especially on some IO modules.

After all this setup, you can now connect the battery and USB cable to start programming your WisBlock Core.

### Software Configuration and Example

The RAK12025 is a gyroscope sensor board that contains an I3G4250D chip. The I3G4250D is a low-power 3-axis angular rate sensor able to provide unprecedented stability at a zero-rate level and sensitivity over temperature and time, with digital I2C/SPI serial interface standard output. 

#### Initial Test of the RAK12025 WisBlock Module

If you already installed the [RAKwireless Arduino BSP](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index), the WisBlock Core and example code should now be available on the Arduino IDE.

1. You need to select first the WisBlock Core you have, as shown in **Figure 6** to **Figure 8**.

/>

2. Copy the [Basic Sample Code for RAK12025](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAK12025-I3G4250D/blob/main/examples/RAK12025_I3G4250D_Gyroscope/RAK12025_I3G4250D_Gyroscope.ino) in Github. It will work on all WisBlock Core. You can open the example codes depending on your WisBlock Core, as shown in **Figure 9**. 

:::tip üìù NOTE:
RAK12025 has other example codes and can be found on [RAK12025-I3G4250D Gyroscope Sensor Module Library Repository](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAK12025-I3G4250D/tree/main/examples).

/>

3. Once the example code is copied, install the [RAKwireless I3G4250D Gyroscope Library](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAK12025-I3G4250D) by clicking the red-highlighted link, as shown in **Figure 10** and **Figure 11**.

  width="100%"
  caption="Successful installing the library for RAK12025 Gyroscope Sensor Module"

4. After successful installation of the library, you can now select the right serial port and upload the code, as shown in **Figure 12** and **Figure 13**.

/>

5. When you have successfully uploaded the example sketch, open the serial monitor of the Arduino IDE to see the sensor's reading logs. If you see the logs, as shown in **Figure 14**, then your RAK12025 is communicating with the WisBlock core properly.
