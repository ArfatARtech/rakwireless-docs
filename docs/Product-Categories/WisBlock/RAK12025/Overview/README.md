## Product Description

RAK12025 is a gyroscope module, part of the RAKWireless WisBlock Sensor series. The module is based on I3G4250D from ST. The I3G4250D is a low-power 3-axis angular rate sensor able to provide unprecedented stability at a zero-rate level and sensitivity over temperature and time. It includes a sensing element and a digital interface capable of providing the measured angular rate. With I3G4250D, RAK12025 can measure rotation speed and report data through a standard I2C digital interface. 

## Product Features

* **Sensor specifications**
    * Selectable full scale (245/500/2000&nbsp;dps)
    * I2C/SPI digital output interface     
    * 16-bit rate value data output
    * 8-bit temperature data output
    * Two digital output lines (interrupt and data ready)

* **Size**
    * 10 x 10&nbsp;mm

## Prerequisites

To use a **RAK12025**, you need at least a **WisBlock Base board** to plug the module in. **WisBlock Base board** is the power supply for the **RAK12025** module. Furthermore, you need a **WisBlock Core** module to use the sensor.
