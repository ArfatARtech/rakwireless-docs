### Description

RAK13007 is a WisBlock Interface module that extends the WisBlock system to be used on isolated digital output applications. There is one digital output that is isolated by an electromechanical relay. The RAK13007 digital output is used to programmatically switch on/off devices operating at high voltage or high current applications.

### Features

- One relay isolated output
- The isolation between internal and external signal is up to 2,500&nbsp;VDC, 50/60&nbsp;Hz for 1 min.
- Inductive Load: 250&nbsp;V<sub>AC</sub> / 5<sub>A</sub> and 30&nbsp;V<sub>DC</sub> / 4<sub>A</sub>
- Resistive Load: 150&nbsp;V<sub>AC</sub> / 10<sub>A</sub> and 30&nbsp;V<sub>DC</sub> / 8<sub>A</sub>
- Module size: 25 x 48&nbsp;mm

## Specifications

### Overview

The overview covers the RAK13007 block diagram and the mounting mechanics of the board into the WisBlock Base board.

#### Mounting

The RAK13007 module can be mounted on the IO slot of the WisBlock Base board. **Figure 2** shows the mounting mechanism of the RAK13007 on a WisBlock Base module, such as a RAK5005-O.

### Hardware

The hardware specification is categorized into four (4) parts. It discusses the pinouts and their corresponding functions and diagrams of the module. It also covers the electrical and mechanical characteristics that include the tabular data of the functionalities and standard values of the RAK13007 WisBlock Relay Module.


#### Pin Definition

The RAK13007 WisBlock module has a 40-pin WisConnector that is compatible to the WisBlock Base IO Slot. The pin order of the connector and the pinout definition is shown in **Figure 5**.

::: tip üìù NOTE
- By default, **IO4** is used as the Digital Output (DO) pin.
- DO pin can be changed by reworking some resistors on the PCB module. There are reserved options to change the GPIO to control DO.
- **3V3_S** voltage output from the WisBlock Base that powers the RAK13007 module can be controlled by the WisBlock Core via WB_IO2 (WisBlock IO2 pin). This makes the module ideal for low-power IoT projects since the WisBlock Core can totally disconnect the power of the RAK13007 module.
