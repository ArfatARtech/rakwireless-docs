## Product Description

RAK12013 is a 3.2&nbsp;GHz microwave radar module based on RCWL-9196. It uses the Doppler radar effect to detect moving objects/motion using microwaves. The RCWL-9196 will transmit and receive a 3.2&nbsp;GHz radar signal and compare the difference between the two signals to determine whether the object is moving or not.

::: tip üìù NOTE
1. Radar signals don't interfere with other signals such as LoRa, WiFi, and Bluetooth; but multiple radar signals interfere with each other between single individuals over a distance greater than 1 meter.
2. The component side of the PCB module is the positive sensing face, while the opposite side is the negative sensing face. The negative sensing face is less effective in terms of sensing.
