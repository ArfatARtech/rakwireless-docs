## Product Description

The RAK12014, a part of the RAKwireless WisBlock Sensor Series, is a Time-of-Flight (ToF) module designed based on VL53L0X from STMicroelectronics. The VL53L0X is a ToF laser-ranging module, providing accurate distance measurement up to 2&nbsp;m. 

The VL53L0X's 940&nbsp;nm VCSEL emitter (Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Laser) is invisible to the human eye and coupled with internal physical infrared filters. It enables longer-ranging distances, higher immunity to ambient light, and better robustness to cover glass optical crosstalk.
