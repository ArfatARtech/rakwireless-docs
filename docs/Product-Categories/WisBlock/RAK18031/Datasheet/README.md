# RAK18031 WisBlock Audio PDM Microphone Module Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

RAK18031 is a WisBlock Audio that extends the WisBlock system based on the MP34DT06JTR module from ST. This module is a mono PDM microphone module, where the analog audio is converted to a Pulse Density Modulation (PDM) output. When used with other WisBlock modules, you can achieve rich applications such as audio monitoring, recording, and even voice control functions.

#### Mounting

##### Mount to WisBlock Base

**Figure 2** shows the mounting mechanism of the RAK18031 module on a [WisBlock Base](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/#wisblock-base) board. The RAK18031 module can be mounted on the IO slots.

##### Mount to Enclosure

If you want to use the RAK18031 with an enclosure, there are two (2) mounting screw holes that are provided to mount the microphone module up against a hole in the enclosure. In this case, an FPC or a [WisBlock IO Extension Cable](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK19008/Overview/) is required to connect the RAK18031 to the WisBlock system.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
- The FPC with the Audio Interposer board is recommended as it provides a better mechanical mounting than the IO extension cable.

#### Schematic Diagram

##### Digital Microphone

The **Pin 2** of the MP34DT06JTR is used to control the MIC as a left or right channel. 

- The MIC is the left channel when **Pin 2** is `HIGH`.
- The MIC is the right channel when **Pin 2** is `LOW`. 

By default, the RAK18031 is the right channel. But, you can remove the 10&nbsp;kŒ© resistor on **R9** and connect it to **R8** to change the MIC to the left channel as its default. You may also use **MIC_CTR_IO1** to select the MIC as the right or left channel.
