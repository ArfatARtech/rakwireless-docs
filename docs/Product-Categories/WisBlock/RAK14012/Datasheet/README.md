# RAK14012 WisBlock LED Matrix Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

RAK14012 is an LED matrix driver module for WS2812B LEDs, which has a control circuit and RGB chip. 

To drive the WS2812B, the RAK14012 has a built-in boost circuit to generate 5&nbsp;V voltage output. But it is recommended to use an external power supply to power the LED Matrix. 


### Features

- LED matrix driver
- 3.3&nbsp;V Power supply
- Module Size: 25&nbsp;mm x 15&nbsp;mm

## Specifications

### Overview 

#### Mounting

The RAK14012 WisBlock LED Matrix can be mounted to the IO slot of the WisBlock Base board. **Figure 1** shows the mounting mechanism of the RAK14012 on a WisBlock Base board, such as the [RAK5005-O](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak5005-o-base-board).

### Hardware
#### Pin Definition

The RAK14012 WisBlock LED Matrix comprises a 40-pin WisConnector. The 40-pin WisConnector allows the RAK14012 module to be mounted to a WisBlock baseboard, such as RAK5005-O. The pin order of the connector and the pinout definition is shown in **Figure 2**.

::: tip üìù NOTE
- The **VBAT**, **GND**, **EN (WB_IO6)**, and **DOUT (WB_IO5)** are connected to WisConnector.

#### Schematic Diagram

It has a boost circuit to generate 5&nbsp;V because the supply for WS2812B must be between 3.7&nbsp;V and 5.3&nbsp;V. It is recommended to use an external power source to power the LED Matrix because of its high power consumption.
