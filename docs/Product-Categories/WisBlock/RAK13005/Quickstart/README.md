## Product Configuration

### Block Diagram

### Hardware Setup

RAK13005 is a WisBlock LIN Module that extends the WisBlock system to be used on communication protocol called Local Interconnect Network (LIN). This communication is initiated by the automotive industry for the communication of in-vehicle devices on cars. Today, LIN is also used in other applications that require a robust communication line. For more information about the RAK13005, refer to the [Datasheet](../Datasheet/).

  width="30%"
  caption="RAK13005 Pin Definition"
/>

#### LIN Peripheral and Controller Mode Hardware Configuration

RAK13005 supports both **Controller(master)** and **Peripheral(slave)** modes. The two modes uses the same RAK13005 circuit design and configuration is simply determined by an SMD resistor. The resistor location is shown in **Figure 2**.

  width="40%"
  caption="RAK13005 LIN Mode Configuration"
/>


#### Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules

##### Assembling

The RAK13005 module can be mounted on the IO slot of the WisBlock Base board, as shown in **Figure 3**. Also, always secure the connection of the WisBlock module by using the compatible screws.

  width="60%"
  caption="RAK13005 mounting connection to WisBlock Base module"
/>

##### RAK13005 Connector Crimping Mechanism

The RAK13005 features a fast-crimping terminal connector to simplify and ensure the wiring process on the fields. The fast-crimping terminal can support cable with a width between 20&nbsp;AWG to 24&nbsp;AWG. The usual stripping length is around 6 to 7&nbsp;mm.

As shown in **Figure 4**, during the crimping process, you should first press down and maintain the spring head of the crimping terminal firmly, then insert the stripped cable head into the corresponding connector‚Äôs hole. Once inserted correctly, release the spring head, and the crimping process is completed.

  width="40%"
  caption="RAK13005 Module Connector"
/>

##### Disassembling

The procedure in disassembling any type of WisBlock modules is the same.

1. First, remove the screws.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak13005/quickstart/16.removing-screws.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Removing screws from the WisBlock module"
/>

2. Once the screws are removed, check the silkscreen of the module to find the correct location where force can be applied.

  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak13005/quickstart/17.detaching-silkscreen.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Detaching silkscreen on the WisBlock module"
/>

3. Apply force to the module at the position of the connector, as shown in **Figure 7**, to detach the module from the baseboard.

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you will connect other modules to the remaining WisBlock Base slots, check on the [WisBlock Pin Mapper](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Pin-Mapper/) tool for possible conflicts.
:::

Now, you can connect the battery (optional) and USB cable to start programming your WisBlock Core.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

- Battery can cause harm if not handled properly.
- Only 3.7-4.2&nbsp;V Rechargeable LiPo batteries are supported. It is highly recommended not to use other types of batteries with the system unless you know what you are doing.
- If a non-rechargeable battery is used, it has to be unplugged first before connecting the USB cable to the USB port of the board to configure the device. Not doing so might damage the battery or cause a fire.
- Make sure the battery wires match the polarity on the RAK WisBlock Base Board. Not all batteries have the same wiring.
- Only 5&nbsp;V solar panels are supported. Do not use 12&nbsp;V solar panels. It will destroy the charging unit and eventually other electronic parts.
