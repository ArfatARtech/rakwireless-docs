### Hardware

The hardware specification is categorized into five parts. It shows the chipset of the module and discusses the pinouts of the module and its corresponding functions and diagrams. It also covers the electrical and mechanical parameters that include the tabular data of the functionalities and standard values of the RAK13004 WisBlock PWM Expander Module.

#### Chipset

The RAK13004 PWM Expander Module uses PCA9685 from NXP Semiconductors.

| Vendor             | Part Number |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| NXP Semiconductors | PCA9685     |

Figure 2 shows PCA9685 device addressing. Default A5, A4, and A3 are connected to ground, and A2, A1, and A0 are optional. It can be connected to 3.3&nbsp;V or GND. Default 7-Bits I2C address is 0x80.

#### Pin Definition

The RAK13004 WisBlock PWM Expander Module comprises a standard WisConnector. The WisConnector allows the RAK13004 module to be mounted on a WisBlock Base board. The pin order of the connector and the pinout definition is shown in Figure 3.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
- **I2C** related pins, **OE**, **3V3_S**, and **GND** are connected to this module.
- **OE** output enable pin, low active, internal pull-up, disable output.
- **3V3_S** voltage output from the WisBlock Base that powers the RAK13004 module can be controlled by the WisBlock Core via WB_IO2 (WisBlock IO2 pin). This makes the module ideal for low-power IoT projects since the WisBlock Core can totally disconnect the power of the RAK13004 module.
