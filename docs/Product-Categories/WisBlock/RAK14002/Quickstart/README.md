## Prerequisite

### What Do You Need?

Before going through each and every step on using RAK14002 WisBlock Touch Sensor module, make sure to prepare the necessary items listed below:

#### Hardware

- [RAK14002](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/3-channel-touch-pad-module-rak14002)
- Your choice of [WisBlock Base](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-base) 
- Your choice of [WisBlock Core](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-core)
- USB Cable
- Li-Ion/LiPo battery (optional)
- Solar charger (optional)

#### Software

- Download and install [ArduinoIDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
- To add the RAKwireless Core boards to your Arduino project, install the RAKwireless Arduino BSP. Follow the steps in the [Github repo](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index).

## Product Configuration

### Hardware Setup

RAK14002 module is part of the WisBlock Interface category and extends the WisBlock system with a  3-channel Capacitive Touch Sensor. The RAK14002 connects to the WisBlock Base Board through the IO slot. The **Figure 1** shows the assembly of a [WisBlock Core](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-core) highlighted in green and the module RAK14002 highlighted in red. Also, always secure the connection of the WisBlock module by using the compatible screws. For more information about RAK14002, refer to the [Datasheet](../Datasheet/).

#### Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules

##### Assembling


As shown in **Figure 2**, the location for the IO slot is properly marked by silkscreen. Follow carefully the procedure defined in [RAK5005-O module assembly/disassembly instructions](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK5005-O-Baseboard-Installation-Guide/) to attach a WisBlock module. Once attached, carefully fix the module with three pieces of M1.2 x 3&nbsp;mm screws.

  caption="RAK14002 connection to WisBlock Base"
/>

##### Disassembling

The procedure in disassembling any type of WisBlock modules is the same. 

1. First, remove the screws.

  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak14002/quickstart/16.removing-screws.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Removing screws from the WisBlock module"
/>

2. Once the screws are removed, check the silkscreen of the module to find the correct location where force can be applied.

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you will connect other modules to the remaining WisBlock Base slots, check on the [WisBlock Pin Mapper](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Pin-Mapper/) tool for possible conflicts. RAK14002 uses I2C and IO pins it can cause possible conflict especially on some IO modules.

After all this setup, you can now connect the battery and USB cable to start programming your WisBlock Core.

### Software Configuration and Example

These are the quick links that go directly to the software guide for the specific WisBlock Core module you use.

  width="100%"
  caption="Select RAK4631 as WisBlock Core"
/>

Arduino programs are usually referred to as sketches. The sketches for this module will be available on the Arduino IDE after Library install.

2. Install the [RAKwireless CAP1293 Library](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAK14002-CAP1293-Library) using Arduino Library Manager.

On Arduino IDE select: Sketch-> Include Library -> Manage Libraries as shown in **Figure 7**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak14002/quickstart/rak4631_manage_library.png"
  width="100%"
