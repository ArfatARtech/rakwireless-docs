# RAK16000 Quick Start Guide

## Prerequisite

### What Do You Need?

Before going through each and every step on using the RAK16000 WisBlock module, make sure to prepare the necessary items listed below:

#### Hardware

- [RAK16000 WisBlock DC Current Sensor](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak16000?utm_source=RAK16000&utm_medium=Document&utm_campaign=BuyFromStore)
- [WisBlock Base](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-base/) with IO slot
- Your choice of [WisBlock Core](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-core)
- USB Cable
- [Li-Ion/LiPo battery (optional)](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-accessory/products/battery-connector-cable?utm_source=BatteryConnector&utm_medium=Document&utm_campaign=BuyFromStore)
- [Solar charger (optional)](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-accessory/products/solar-panel-connector-cable?utm_source=SolarPanelConnector&utm_medium=Document&utm_campaign=BuyFromStore)


#### Software

##### Arduino

- Download and install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
- To add the RAKwireless Core boards on your Arduino Boards Manager, install the [RAKwireless Arduino BSP](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index).

## Product Configuration

### Hardware Setup

RAK16000 is a part of the WisBlock Sensor Series that is capable of measuring DC current in the range of 0 to 3&nbsp;A in a voltage range of 0 to 26&nbsp;V. With the two measured DC values, you get the power consumption by multiplying the current and voltage. Additionally, this module uses the INA219BID from Texas Instruments that offers high accuracy maximum rate of 0.5% over temperature.

The current measurement method used is the high-side, where the shunt resistor is placed between the power supply and the load. This method allows the RAK16000 to measure both the circulating current and the voltage across the load.

For more information about the RAK16000, refer to the [Datasheet](../Datasheet/).

#### Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules

##### Assembling Procedure

As shown in **Figure 2**, the location for the IO slot is properly marked by silkscreen. Follow carefully the procedure defined in [WisBlock Base board assembly/disassembly instructions](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK5005-O-Baseboard-Installation-Guide/) to attach a WisBlock module. Once attached, carefully fix the module with one or more pieces of M1.2 x 3&nbsp;mm screws depending on the module.

##### Disassembling Procedure

The procedure in disassembling any type of WisBlock modules is the same.

1. First, remove the screws.

  width="70%"
  caption="Removing screws from the WisBlock module"
/>

2. Once the screws are removed, check the silkscreen of the module to find the correct location where force can be applied.

3. Apply force to the module at the position of the connector, as shown in **Figure 5**, to detach the module from the baseboard.

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you will connect other modules to the remaining WisBlock Base slots, check on the [WisBlock Pin Mapper](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Pin-Mapper/) tool for possible conflicts.
:::

Now, you can connect the battery (optional) and USB cable to start programming your WisBlock Core.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
- Batteries can cause harm if not handled properly.
- Only 3.7-4.2&nbsp;V Rechargeable LiPo batteries are supported. It is highly recommended not to use other types of batteries with the system unless you know what you are doing.
- If a non-rechargeable battery is used, it has to be unplugged first before connecting the USB cable to the USB port of the board to configure the device. Not doing so might damage the battery or cause a fire.
- Only 5&nbsp;V solar panels are supported. Do not use 12&nbsp;V solar panels. It will destroy the charging unit and eventually other electronic parts.
- Make sure the battery wires match the polarity on the WisBlock Base board. Not all batteries have the same wiring.

### Software Configuration and Example

#### Initial Test of the RAK16000 WisBlock Module

1. Install the [RAKwireless Arduino BSP's for WisBlock](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index) by using the `package_rakwireless_index.json` board installation package, the WisBlock Core should now be available on the Arduino IDE.

2. You need to select first the WisBlock Core you have.

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you experience any error in compiling the example sketch, check the updated code for your WisBlock Core Module that can be found on the [RAK16000 WisBlock Example Code Repository](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/tree/master/examples/common/IO/RAK16000_DcCurrent_INA219) and this sample code in Github will work on all WisBlock Core.
:::

4. Once the example sketch is open, install the [INA219_WE](https://github.com/wollewald/INA219_WE) library by clicking the yellow-highlighted link, as shown in **Figure 9** and **Figure 10**.

5. Now, you can select the right port and upload the code, as shown in **Figure 11** and **Figure 12**.

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you are using the RAK11200 as your WisBlock Core, the RAK11200 requires the **Boot0** pin to be configured properly first before uploading. If not done properly, uploading the source code to RAK11200 will fail. Check the full details on the [RAK11200 Quick Start Guide](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK11200/Quickstart/#uploading-to-wisblock).
