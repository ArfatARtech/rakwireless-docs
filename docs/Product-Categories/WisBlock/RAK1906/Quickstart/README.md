- Install the RAKwireless Arduino BSP and add the RAKwireless Core boards to your **Arduino Boards Manager**. Follow the steps in the [Github repo](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index).

## Product Configuration

### Hardware Setup

WisBlock can integrate this module, which makes it easy to build up an environmental temperature and humidity data acquisition system. 

For more information about the RAK1906, refer to the [Datasheet](../Datasheet/).

The RAK1906 module gives information about:

- Air pressure
- Air quality
- Ambient Air Temperature
- Environment Humidity

RAK1906 module can be connected to the sensor's slot of [WisBlock Base](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/#wisblock-base) to communicate with the WisBlock Core, as shown in **Figure 1**. It will work on **SLOT A to F**. Also, always secure the connection of the WisBlock module by using compatible screws.

#### Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules

##### Assembling

As shown in **Figure 2**, the location for Slot A, B, C, and D are properly marked by silkscreen. Slots C and D are located on bottom of WisBlock Base. Follow carefully the procedure defined in [WisBlock Base board assembly/disassembly instructions](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK5005-O-Baseboard-Installation-Guide/) to attach a WisBlock module. Once attached, carefully fix the module with a M1.2 x 3&nbsp;mm screw.

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you will connect other modules to the remaining WisBlock Base slots, check on the [WisBlock Pin Mapper](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Pin-Mapper/) tool for possible conflicts. RAK1906 uses I2C communication lines, and it can cause possible conflict especially on some IO modules. 
:::


After all this setup, you can now connect the battery (optional) and USB cable to start programming the RAK1906.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
- Batteries can cause harm if not handled properly.
- Only 3.7-4.2&nbsp;V Rechargeable LiPo batteries are supported. It is highly recommended not to use other types of batteries with the system unless you know what you are doing.
- If a non-rechargeable battery is used, it has to be unplugged first before connecting the USB cable to the USB port of the board to configure the device. Not doing so might damage the battery or cause a fire.
- Only 5&nbsp;V solar panels are supported. Do not use 12&nbsp;V solar panels. It will destroy the charging unit and eventually other electronic parts.
- Make sure the battery wires match the polarity on the WisBlock Base board. Not all batteries have the same wiring.
:::

### Software Configuration and Example

The RAK1906 is a 4-in-1 Environmental Sensor board that contains the Bosch BME680 chip. It is specially designed for wearables where size and low power consumption are critical requirements. The BME680 contains a small Metal-Oxide (MOX) sensor and an I2C interface used to communicate with WisBlock Core.

::: warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING    
The BME680 requires a burn-in period to collect accurate readings. The burn-in procedure can be achieved by reading all sensors once every 5 seconds for at least 20 minutes the first time that you use it. For each subsequent use, the readings should stabilize 2-3 minutes after power-up.
:::


#### Initial Test of the RAK1906 WisBlock Module

1. Install the [RAKwireless Arduino BSP's for WisBlock](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index) by using the `package_rakwireless_index.json` board installation package, the WisBlock Core should now be available on the Arduino IDE.

6. The RAK1906_Environment_BME680 application gets BME680 sensor data every 5 seconds and prints the results on the serial port.

```js
Temperature = 30.66 *C
Pressure = 1013.80 hPa
Humidity = 44.38 %
Gas = 3.89 KOhms

Temperature = 30.69 *C
Pressure = 1013.78 hPa
Humidity = 44.59 %
Gas = 3.88 KOhms

Temperature = 30.72 *C
Pressure = 1013.82 hPa
Humidity = 44.37 %
Gas = 3.87 KOhms
```

## LoRaWAN Environment Monitoring with RAK1906

This solution shows how to create an environmental data sensor node. The sensor node measures air temperature, air humidity, barometric pressure, and gas levels. After the node joins to server successfully, it then transmits this data periodically to a LoRaWan¬Æ server.

### Configuring LoRaWAN


There are configurations that you need to setup to ensure that the device can join a LoRaWAN Network server.

The steps below will explain the default settings and how to configure it.

1. Set up the LoRa Region.

Default region is EU868.

```
LoRaMacRegion_t g_CurrentRegion = LORAMAC_REGION_EU868;
```

You can change this to a region that is applicable to you like `LORAMAC_REGION_US915`, `LORAMAC_REGION_AU915`, etc.

2. Set up the LoRaWAN activation method.

Default is **OTAA**.

```
bool doOTAA = true;
```

To configure the device to ABP, you need to make this boolean variable `false`.

3. Set up the message type if confirmed or not.

Default is **confirmed message**.

```
lmh_confirm g_CurrentConfirm = LMH_CONFIRMED_MSG;
```

You can change to unconfirmed message by changing the value to `LMH_UNCONFIRMED_MSG`.

4. Set up device class.

Default is **Class A**.

```
DeviceClass_t g_CurrentClass = CLASS_A;	
```

You can change this to **CLASS_B** (still under development) or **CLASS_C**.

5. Set up the keys.

- Configuration keys for OTAA Activation:

```
uint8_t nodeDeviceEUI[8] = {0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x33, 0x33};
uint8_t nodeAppEUI[8] = {0xB8, 0x27, 0xEB, 0xFF, 0xFE, 0x39, 0x00, 0x00};
uint8_t nodeAppKey[16] = {0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88};
```

- Configuration keys for ABP Activation:

```
uint32_t nodeDevAddr = 0x260116F8;
uint8_t nodeNwsKey[16] = {0x7E, 0xAC, 0xE2, 0x55, 0xB8, 0xA5, 0xE2, 0x69, 0x91, 0x51, 0x96, 0x06, 0x47, 0x56, 0x9D, 0x23};
uint8_t nodeAppsKey[16] = {0xFB, 0xAC, 0xB6, 0x47, 0xF3, 0x58, 0x45, 0xC7, 0x50, 0x7D, 0xBF, 0x16, 0x8B, 0xA8, 0xC1, 0x7C};
```

6. Set up uplink period.

The default is **20000&nbsp;mS**. 

```
#define LORAWAN_APP_INTERVAL 20000
```


### Data Format 


| Byte1 | Byte2        | Byte3        | Byte4     | Byte5     |
| ----- | ------------ | ------------ | --------- | --------- |
| 1     | Temperature1 | Temperature2 | Humidity1 | Humidity2 |


| Byte6       | Byte7       | Byte8       | Byte9       | Byte10 | Byte11 | Byte12 | Byte13 |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Barometric1 | Barometric2 | Barometric3 | Barometric4 | Gas1   | Gas2   | Gas3   | Gas4   |



  - Byte1 is a marker for the data type, here always 1.    
  - Every byte value is MSB first.
  - Temperature is sent as two bytes, enlarged 100 times for accuracy. For example, 2510 means 25.01 C, sent as 0x09 0xCE.
  - Humidity is sent as two bytes, enlarged 100 times for accuracy. For example, 4173 means 41.73%, sent as 0x10 0x4D.
  - Barometric pressure is sent as four bytes, enlarged 100 times for accuracy. For example, 100945 means 1009.45&nbsp;hPa, sent as 0x00 0x01 0x8A 0x51.
  - Gas resistance is sent as four bytes. For example, 63560&nbsp;Ohm, sent as 0x00 0x00 0xF8 0x48.


### Attention

If this example is implemented for the Region US915, DR0 cannot be used because the package size is too large to fit into the allowed payload.    

<!-- add RAK11310 log images
-->
When you successfully uploaded the example sketch, open the Serial Monitor of the Arduino IDE to see the sensor's reading logs. If you see the logs, as shown below, then your RAK1906 is properly communicating to the WisBlock core.
