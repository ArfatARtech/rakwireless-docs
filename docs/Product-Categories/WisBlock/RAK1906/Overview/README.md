## Product Description

The RAK1906 WisBlock Environmental Sensor Module, part of the RAK WisBlock Sensor series, is a 4-in-1 digital sensor board that comprises gas, humidity, pressure, and temperature sensor, based on the Bosch® BME680 module. The RAK1906 is ideal for applications such as indoor air quality, home automation, and building IoT solutions.

## Product Features

* **Sensor specifications**
    * Voltage supply: 3.3&nbsp;V
    * Current consumption: 0.15&nbsp;uA to 350&nbsp;uA
    * Chipset: BOSCH BME680
    * Temperature range: -40&nbsp;°C to 85&nbsp;°C
    * Humidity range: 0 to 100%
    * Pressure range: 300&nbsp;hPa to 1100&nbsp;hPa
    * Gas sensor response time < 1&nbsp;sec
    * Sensor outputs can be used with the [Bosch BSEC library](https://github.com/BoschSensortec/BSEC-Arduino-library) algorithm to calculate the IAQ (Indoor Air Quality) index

* **Size**
    * 10 x 10&nbsp;mm

## Prerequisites

To use a **RAK1906**, you need at least a **WisBlock Base** to plug the module in. **WisBlock Base** provides power supply to the **RAK1906** module. Furthermore, you need a **WisBlock Core** module to use the sensor.

::: warning ⚠️ WARNING
Make sure to fix the module with the screws to ensure a proper function.
