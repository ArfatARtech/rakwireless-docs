  width="50%"
  caption="Connecting the RAK13002 to the I2C backpack of a 16x2 LCD"
/>

1. You need to select first the WisBlock Core you have, as shown in **Figure 7** to **Figure 9**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak13002/quickstart/selectboard4631.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Selecting RAK4631 as WisBlock Core"

  width="100%"
  caption="Selecting RAK11300 as WisBlock Core"
/>

2. On the Arduino IDE, go to **Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries**. The Library Manager should open, then install the [LiquidCrystal I2C](https://github.com/johnrickman/LiquidCrystal_I2C) library, as shown in **Figure 10**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak13002/quickstart/I2C/i2c_library.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Installing the LiquidCrystal I2C library"
/>

3. After successful installation of the library, you can now copy the following sample code into your Arduino IDE:

```c
#include LiquidCrystal_I2C.h

#include Wire.h

//initialize the liquid crystal library
//the first parameter is the I2C address
//the second parameter is how many rows are on your screen
//the third parameter is how many columns are on your screen
LiquidCrystal_I2C lcd(0x27, 16, 2);

void setup() {
  lcd.init();   //initialize lcd screen
  lcd.backlight(); // turn on the backlight
}
void loop() {

  start_display(); // star
  delay(1000); //wait for a second
  lcd.clear(); // clear the LCD content
  delay(1000); //wait for a second

}

void start_display(){

  lcd.setCursor(0,0); // tell the screen to write on the top row
  lcd.print("RAK13002");  // tell the screen to write ‚ÄúRAK13002‚Äù on the top row
  lcd.setCursor(0,1); // tell the screen to write on the bottom row
  lcd.print("EXAMPLE");  // tell the screen to write ‚ÄúEXAMPLE‚Äù on the bottom row

}
```
4. Then select the right Serial Port and upload the code, as shown in **Figure 11** and **Figure 12**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak13002/quickstart/I2C/select_port.png"
  width="100%"

/>

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak13002/quickstart/I2C/upload.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Uploading the sample code"
/>

5. When you successfully uploaded the sample code, you will now be able to see the "RAK13002 EXAMPLE" in your LCD screen, as shown in **Figure 13**, which means that the module is properly communicating with the WisBlock core using the I2C protocol.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak13002/quickstart/I2C/lcd_output.png"
  width="40%"
  caption="RAK13002 EXAMPLE displayed on 16x2 LCD"
/>

6. If you are not seeing the same output, check the device's I2C address by using this code:

```c
/*
 * Scan the I2C Address of your LCD using
 * this example code. Make sure your SDA and SCL
 * line is connected properly.
 *
 * Follow the connection of LCD with I2C Backpack to RAK13002.
 */
#include <Wire.h> //include Wire.h library

void setup()
{
  Wire.begin(); // Wire communication begin
  Serial.begin(9600); // The baudrate of Serial monitor is set in 9600
  while (!Serial); // Waiting for Serial Monitor
  Serial.println("\nI2C Scanner");
}

void loop()
{
  byte error, address; //variable for error and I2C address
  int nDevices;

  Serial.println("Scanning...");

  nDevices = 0;
  for (address = 1; address < 127; address++ )
  {
    // The i2c_scanner uses the return value of
    // the Wire.endTransmission to see if
    // a device did acknowledge to the address.
    Wire.beginTransmission(address);
    error = Wire.endTransmission();

    if (error == 0)
    {
      Serial.print("I2C device found at address 0x");
      if (address < 16)
        Serial.print("0");
      Serial.print(address, HEX);
      Serial.println("  !");
      nDevices++;
    }
    else if (error == 4)
    {
      Serial.print("Unknown error at address 0x");
      if (address < 16)
        Serial.print("0");
      Serial.println(address, HEX);
    }
  }
  if (nDevices == 0)
    Serial.println("No I2C devices found\n");
  else
    Serial.println("done\n");

  delay(5000); // wait 5 seconds for the next I2C scan
}

```

7. Your device's I2C address should be displayed on the Serial Monitor, as shown in **Figure 14**.

2. Copy the following sample code into your Arduino IDE:

```c
/*
 * Reading Long Press and Short Press on a Button using RAK13002
 *
 */

// constants won't change. They're used here to set pin numbers:
const int BUTTON_PIN = WB_IO1; // the number of the pushbutton pin
const int SHORT_PRESS_TIME = 500; // 500 milliseconds

// Variables will change:
int lastState = LOW;  // the previous state from the input pin
int currentState;     // the current reading from the input pin
unsigned long pressedTime  = 0;
unsigned long releasedTime = 0;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(BUTTON_PIN, INPUT_PULLUP);
}

void loop() {
  // read the state of the switch/button:
  currentState = digitalRead(BUTTON_PIN);

  if(lastState == HIGH && currentState == LOW)        // button is pressed
    pressedTime = millis();
  else if(lastState == LOW && currentState == HIGH) { // button is released
    releasedTime = millis();

    long pressDuration = releasedTime - pressedTime;

    if( pressDuration < SHORT_PRESS_TIME )
      Serial.println("A short press is detected");
  }

  // save the the last state
  lastState = currentState;
}
```

3. Then select the right Serial Port and upload the code, as shown in **Figure 19** and **Figure 20**.
