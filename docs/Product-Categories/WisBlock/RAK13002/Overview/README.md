## Product Description

The RAK13002 is a WisBlock Core adaptor module that can be mounted to the IO slot of the WisBlock Base board. This module exposed all WisBlock Core signals such as I2C, SPI, UART, GPIO, and ADC to standard 2.54&nbsp;mm pitch pin header for easy integration of external components and devices.

## Product Features

- Supports two I2C interfaces
- Supports two UART interfaces
- Supports one SPI interface
- Supports up to six (6) GPIOs
- Supports two (2) ADC interfaces
- 3.3&nbsp;V power supply interfaces
- Backup battery (super cap) can keep the RTC running for up to 7 days (tested in lab)
- Module size: 25X35&nbsp;mm

## Prerequisites

To use a **RAK13002**, you need at least a **WisBlock Base** to plug the module in. **WisBlock Base** is the power supply for the **RAK13002** module. Furthermore, you need a **WisBlock Core** module to use the module.
