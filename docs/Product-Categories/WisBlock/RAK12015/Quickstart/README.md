## Product Configuration

### Hardware Setup

The RAK12015, a part of WisBlock Sensor, is a Vibration Detection Module that uses a high-precision sensor, the ANT-801S. This sensor is capable of detecting micro shocks or vibration without direction limits. For more information about RAK12015, refer to the [Datasheet](../Datasheet/).

The RAK12015 WisBlock Vibration Detection Module can be mounted on the IO slot of the WisBlock Base board, as shown in **Figure 1**. Also, always secure the connection of the WisBlock module by using compatible screws.

#### Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules

##### Assembling


As shown in **Figure 2**, the location for the IO slot is properly marked by silkscreen. Follow carefully the procedure defined in [RAK5005-O module assembly/disassembly instructions](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK5005-O-Baseboard-Installation-Guide/) to attach a WisBlock module. Once attached, carefully fix the module with three pieces of M1.2 x 3&nbsp;mm screws.

  width="70%"
  caption="RAK12015 assembly to WisBlock Base"
/>

##### Disassembling

The procedure in disassembling any type of WisBlock modules is the same. 

1. First, remove the screws.  

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak12015/quickstart/removing_screw.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Removing screws from the WisBlock module"
/>

2. Once the screws are removed, check the silkscreen of the module to find the correct location where force can be applied.

  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak12015/quickstart/detach_silkscreen.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Detaching silkscreen on the WisBlock module"
/>

3. Apply force to the module at the position of the connector, as shown in **Figure 5**, to detach the module from the baseboard.

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you will connect other modules to the remaining WisBlock Base slots, check on the [WisBlock Pin Mapper](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Pin-Mapper/) tool for possible conflicts. 
:::  

After all this setup, you can now connect the battery (optional) and USB cable to start programming your WisBlock Core.

### Software Configuration and Example

In this example, you will monitor if this sensor is triggered by nearby vibrations.


1. You need to select first the WisBlock Core you have, as shown in **Figure 6** to **Figure 8**.

2. Copy the example code below:

#include <Arduino.h>
#include "Wire.h"
#define SensorOutput   WB_A1
uint8_t interrupt1Flag = 0;

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  time_t timeout = millis();
  Serial.begin(115200);
  /* WisBLOCK 12015 Power On*/
  pinMode(WB_IO2, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(WB_IO2, HIGH);
  delay(300);
  /* WisBLOCK 12015 Power On*/
  while (!Serial)
  {
    if ((millis() - timeout) < 5000)
    {
      delay(100);
    }
    else
    {
      break;
    }
  }
  //falling edge fires , triggers interrupt a1, and calls the interrupt flag function
  pinMode(SensorOutput, INPUT);
  attachInterrupt(SensorOutput, interruptHandle1, RISING);
  Serial.println("RAK12015 test Example");
}


/*
 * brief:The threshold of the sensor is determined by the resistance of the pull-up resistor. 
 * Now the pull-up resistance is 10K
 */
void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  if (interrupt1Flag == 1)
  {
    Serial.println("Trigger vibration sensor");
    interrupt1Flag=0;
  }
  delay(500);
}

void interruptHandle1(void)
{
  interrupt1Flag = 1;
}
```


:::tip üìù NOTE:
If you experience any error in compiling the example sketch, check the updated code for the RAK12015 WisBlock Vibration Detection Module that can be found on the [RAK12015 WisBlock Example Code Repository](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/tree/561cfc8ad9d1b0f8c8f2e5c7223f5fd4d45f273f/examples/common/IO/RAK12015_Shock_801S.ino)
:::


3. Then select the right Serial Port and upload the code, as shown in **Figure 9** and **Figure 10**.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
RAK11200 requires the BOOT0 pin to be configured properly before uploading. If not done properly, uploading the source code to RAK11200 will fail. Check the full details on the [RAK11200 Quick Start Guide](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK11200/Quickstart/#uploading-to-wisblock).

4. When you have successfully uploaded the sample code, lay the module flat on the table and hit or stomp the table, as shown in **Figure 11**. Then, you can open up your serial monitor to get the sensor reading, as shown in **Figure 12**.
