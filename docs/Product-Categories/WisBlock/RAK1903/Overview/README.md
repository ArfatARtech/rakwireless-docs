## Product Description

The RAK1903 WisBlock Sensor module, part of the RAK Wireless Wisblock series, is a single-chip ambient light sensor, measuring the intensity of light in the visible range. The precise spectral response and strong IR rejection of the device enables the RAK1903 module to accurately measure the intensity of light as seen by human eyes regardless of light sources. The strong IR rejection also aids in maintaining high accuracy when the industrial design requires to mount the sensor under dark glass due to aesthetic reasons. The RAK1903 module is designed for systems that create light-based experiences for humans. It is an ideal replacement for photodiodes, photoresistors, or other ambient light sensors with less visible range matching and IR rejection.

## Product Features

* **Sensor specifications**
    * 0.01 to 83865 lux measurement range     
    * Optical filtering to match human eye    
    * Typical 1.8&nbsp;uA power consumption    

* **Size**
    * 10 x 10&nbsp;mm

## Prerequisites

To use a **RAK1903**, you need at least a **WisBlock Base** to plug the module in. **WisBlock Base** is the power supply for the **RAK1903** module. Furthermore, you need a **WisBlock Core** module to use the sensor.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
