# RAK1903 Quick Start Guide

<!--
## Introduction

This guide introduces the WisBlock Sensor RAK1903 Ambient Light board and how to program with it.

The information obtained from the OPT3001DNPR light sensor will then be printed over the USB debug port of the WisBlock Base board.

-->

## Prerequisite

### What Do You Need?

Before going through each and every step on using the RAK1903 WisBlock module, make sure to prepare the necessary items listed below:

#### Hardware

- [RAK1903](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-sensor/products/rak1903-opt3001dnpr-ambient-light-sensor)
- Your choice of [WisBlock Base](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-base) 
- Your choice of [WisBlock Core](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-core)
- USB Cable
- [Li-Ion/LiPo battery (optional)](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-accessory/products/battery-connector-cable)
- [Solar charger (optional)](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-accessory/products/solar-panel-connector-cable)

#### Software

- Download and install [ArduinoIDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
- To add the RAKwireless Core boards on your Arduino board, install the RAKwireless Arduino BSP. Follow the steps in the [Github repo](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index).

## Product Configuration

### Hardware Setup

WisBlock can integrate this module which makes it easy to build up an ambient light data acquisition system. 

For more information about RAK1903, refer to the [Datasheet](../Datasheet/).

The RAK1903 module gives us information about:

- Ambient Light

RAK1903 module can be connected to any slot of WisBlock Base to communicate with the WisBlock Core. It will work on **SLOT A to D**. Also, always secure the connection of the WisBlock module by using compatible screws.

#### Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules

##### Assembling

As shown in **Figure 2**, the location for Slot A, B, C, and D are properly marked by silkscreen. Follow carefully the procedure defined in [RAK5005-O module assembly/disassembly instructions](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK5005-O-Baseboard-Installation-Guide/) to attach a WisBlock module. Once attached, carefully fix the module with one or more pieces of M1.2 x 3&nbsp;mm screws depending on the module.

  width="70%"
  caption="RAK1903 connection to WisBlock Base"
/>

##### Disassembling

The procedure in disassembling any type of WisBlock modules is the same. 

1. First, remove the screws.

  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak1903/quickstart/16.removing-screws.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Removing screws from the WisBlock module"
/>

2. Once the screws are removed, check the silkscreen of the module to find the correct location where force can be applied.

3. Apply force to the module at the position of the connector, as shown in **Figure 5**, to detach the module from the baseboard.

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you will connect other modules to the remaining WisBlock Base slots, check on the [WisBlock Pin Mapper](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Pin-Mapper/) tool for possible conflicts. RAK1903 uses I2C communication lines, and it can cause possible conflict especially on some IO modules. 
:::


After all this setup, you can now connect the battery and USB cable to start programming your WisBlock Core.

### Software Configuration and Example

The RAK1903 is an ambient optical sensor board that contains an OPT3001DNPR chip. The OPT3001DNPR is a single-chip lux meter, measuring the intensity of optical as visible by the human eye. The device comprises a sensing element and an IC interface that communicates through I2C from the sensing element to the application.
