### Hardware  
  
The hardware specification is categorized into five parts that cover the chipset and pinouts and the corresponding functions and diagrams of the board. It also presents the parameters and their standard values in terms of electrical and mechanical.

#### Chipset

The RAK12500 utilizes a very accurate u-blox ZOE-M8Q chip. See the manufacturer's [u-blox ZOE-M8Q Page](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/zoe-m8-series) for more details.  

| Vendor | Part number |
| :----: | :---------: |
| u-blox |   ZOE-M8Q   |


#### Pin Definition

The RAK12500 WisBlock GNSS Location Module comprises a standard WisBlock connector. The WisBlock connector allows the RAK12500 module to be mounted to a WisBlock Base board. The pin order of the connector and the pinout definition is shown in **Figure 3**.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
Only the UART and I2C related pin, 1PPS pin, RESET pin, VDD, and GND are connected to this module
:::

If a 24-pin WisBlock Sensor connector is used, the IO used for the output pulse depends on what slot the module is plugged in. The following table shows the default IO used for different slots:

| SLOT A     | SLOT C   |
| ---------- | -------- |
| UART / I2C | I2C Only |
