## Product Description

**RAK13011** is a Magnetic Switch Sensor module, part of the **WisBlock Sensor Series**. This sensor is essentially a reed switch assembly consisting of a magnet and a reed switch whose contacts are normally open. The contacts close when the magnet is less than 13&nbsp;mm away. Its switch is not affected by nearby (5&nbsp;cm distance) located electrical motors. The reed switch and magnet are housed in durable ABS plastic and can easily mount to most surfaces with screws. They can also be mounted by using double-sided foam tape.
