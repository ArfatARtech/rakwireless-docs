# RAK17000 WisBlock Motor Control Module Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

The RAK17000 is a DC motor driver module. It can be mounted to the IO Slot of the WisBlock Base of your choice. It can drive one stepper motor or two DC motors. The RAK17000 module uses the DRV8833 motor driver IC from Texas Instruments.


### Features

- Drive two DC motors or one stepper motor
- Wide power supply voltage range: 2.7 to 10.8&nbsp;V
- Motor power supply can be from an external source or from the WisBlock Base battery
- Output current control 
- Selection of power source can be done via 2.54&nbsp;mm 2-pin jumper
- Module size: 25X35&nbsp;mm

### Applications

- Battery-Powered Mechanical Devices
- Automation Machines
- Robotics

## Specifications

### Overview

#### Mounting 

The RAK17000 module can be mounted to the slots IO of the WisBlock Base board. Figure 1 shows the mounting mechanism of the RAK17000 on a WisBlock Base module, such as the RAK5005-O.

### Hardware

The hardware specification is categorized into five parts. It shows the chipset of the module and discusses the pinouts and the corresponding functions and diagrams of the module. It also covers the electrical and mechanical characteristics that include the tabular data of the functionalities and standard values of the RAK17000 WisBlock Motor Drive Module.

#### Chipset

The RAK17000 motor drive module uses DRV8833 from Texas Instruments. 

| Vendor            | Part Number |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| Texas Instruments | DRV8833     |

#### Pin Definition

The RAK17000 WisBlock motor drive module comprises a standard WisBlock connector for the IO slot. The WisBlock connector allows the RAK17000 module to be mounted on a WisBlock Base Board, such as RAK5005-O. The pin order of the connector and the pinout definition is shown in Figure 2.
