## Product Description

**RAK11200** is a **WisBlock Core** module for RAK **WisBlock** based on Espressif ESP32-WROVER. It is a powerful, generic WiFi-BLE MCU module that targets a wide variety of applications. There are two CPU cores that can be individually controlled and the CPU clock frequency is adjustable from 80&nbsp;MHz to 240&nbsp;MHz. The low-power deep-sleep current consumption of the ESP32-WROVER is about 10&nbsp;uA. This makes the **RAK11200** an ultra-low-power communication solution. **RAK11200** can be comfortably programmed with the Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.

## Product Features
 
* Two low-power Xtensa¬Æ 32-bit LX6 microprocessors      
* Up to 240&nbsp;MHz CPU clock
* Built-in PCB antenna
* 4&nbsp;MB External SPI Flash, 520&nbsp;KB RAM   
* 8&nbsp;MB SPI Pseudo static RAM (PSRAM) 
* WiFi 802.11 b/g/n (802.11n up to 150&nbsp;Mbps)     
* Bluetooth v4.2 BR/EDR and BLE specification
* Rich set of peripherals: RTC, UART, I2C, SPI, SD card interface  
* Low-power deep-sleep mode 

## Prerequisites

To use a **RAK11200**, you need at least a **WisBlock Base** to plug the module in. **WisBlock Base** is the power supply for the **RAK11200** module and has the programming/debug interface.
