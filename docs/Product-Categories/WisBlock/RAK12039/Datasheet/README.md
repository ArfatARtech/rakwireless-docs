### Hardware

The hardware specification is categorized into five (5) parts. It shows the chipset of the module and discusses the pinouts and their corresponding functions and diagrams. It also covers the electrical and mechanical characteristics that include the tabular data of the functionalities and standard values of the RAK12039 WisBlock Particle Matter Sensor Module.


####  Chipset

| Vendor    | Part number |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Plantower | PMSA003I    |

#### Pin Definition

The RAK12039 WisBlock Particle Matter Sensor Module comprises a standard 40-pin WisConnector. The WisConnector allows the RAK12039 module to be mounted to a WisBlock Base Board. The pin order of the connector and the pinout definition is shown in **Figure 4**.

#### Schematic Diagram

The I2C address of RAK12039 is 0x12. R10 and R11 do not need to be mounted on the RAK12039 due to the pull-up resistors already on the WisBlock Base board.

####  PMSA003I Installation Notes

1) Metal shell is connected to the GND, so be careful not to let it get shorted with the other parts of the circuit.
2) The best way of installation is to make the plane of the inlet and outlet close to the plane of the host. Or some shield should be placed between the inlet and outlet to prevent the airflow from the inner loop.
3) The blowhole in the shell of the host should not be smaller than the inlet.
4) The sensor should not be installed in the airflow way of the air cleaner or should be shielded by some structure.
5) When the sensor is used for outdoor fixed equipment, the equipment should be completed with protection from the sandstorm, rain, snow, etc.
6) The two screw holes can be used for positioning and fixing. For fixing holes, the screw depth can reach 3.4&nbsp;mm, and the other should not exceed 1.9&nbsp;mm.
