# RAK19005 WisBlock Sensor Extension Cable Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

The RAK19005 is a **WisBlock Sensor Extension Cable** used to position small WisBlock modules apart from the WisBlock Base board. This helps to eliminate the influence of other WisBlock modules from sensors that measure environmental data. The advantage of using RAK19005 is to enable the design of a new enclosure that exposes sensors directly to the environment without problems.

### Features

* 120&nbsp;mm length
* All signals of the 24-pin Slot A to D connectors are available
* Compatible with many WisBlock modules with 24-pin WisConnector
* Easy click and use application

## Specifications
