# RAK12011 Quick Start Guide

<!--
## Introduction

This guide introduces the RAK12011 WisBlock Barometer WT Sensor and how to program with it.


-->

## Prerequisite

### What Do You Need?

Before going through each and every step on using the RAK12011 WisBlock module, make sure to prepare the necessary items listed below:

#### Hardware

- [RAK12011 WisBlock Barometer WT Sensor Module](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/wisblock-barometer-wt-sensor-rak12011)
- Your choice of [WisBlock Base](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-base) 
- Your choice of [WisBlock Core](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-core)
- USB Cable
- [Li-Ion/LiPo battery (optional)](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-accessory/products/battery-connector-cable)
- [Solar charger (optional)](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-accessory/products/solar-panel-connector-cable)

#### Software

- Download and install [ArduinoIDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
- To add the RAKwireless Core boards on your Arduino board, install the RAKwireless Arduino BSP. Follow the steps in the [Github repo](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index).

## Product Configuration

### Hardware Setup

RAK12011 is a water-resistant WisBlock module that can measure temperature and pressure. You can safely deploy it in areas where water exposure is highly probable. The sensor itself is water protected while the PCB is coated with conformal coating.

For more information about RAK12011, refer to the [Datasheet](../Datasheet/).

The RAK12011 module gives information about:
- Barometric Pressure
- Environment Temperature

RAK12011 module can be connected to the sensor's slot of [WisBlock Base](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/#wisblock-base) to communicate with the WisBlock Core, as shown in **Figure 1**. It will work on **SLOT A, C to F**. Also, always secure the connection of the WisBlock module by using compatible screws.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
RAK12011 has one digital output line, so you need one GPIO from WisBlock Core. It means RAK12011 should be used on a sensor slot with one available GPIO. However, WB_IO2 is used to control 3V3_S. Hence, RAK12011 is used only on slots without WB_IO2 like sensor slots A, C to F on WisBlock Base board.

#### Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules

##### Assembling

As shown in **Figure 2**, the location for Slot A, B, C, and D are properly marked by silkscreen. Follow carefully the procedure defined in [WisBlock Base board assembly/disassembly instructions](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK5005-O-Baseboard-Installation-Guide/) to attach a WisBlock module. Once attached, carefully fix the module with one or more pieces of M1.2 x 3&nbsp;mm screws depending on the module.

  width="50%"
  caption="RAK12011 connection to WisBlock Base"
/>

##### Disassembling

The procedure in disassembling any type of WisBlock modules is the same. 

1. First, remove the screws.  

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak12011/quickstart/removing-screws.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Removing screws from the WisBlock module"
/>

2. Once the screws are removed, check the silkscreen of the module to find the correct location where force can be applied.

  width="70%"
  caption="Detaching silkscreen on the WisBlock module"

3. Apply force to the module at the position of the connector, as shown in **Figure 5**, to detach the module from the baseboard.

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you will connect other modules to the remaining WisBlock Base slots, check on the [WisBlock Pin Mapper](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Pin-Mapper/) tool for possible conflicts. RAK12011 uses I2C communication lines, and it can cause possible conflict especially on some IO modules. 
:::


After all this setup, you can now connect the battery (optional) and USB cable to start programming your WisBlock Core.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
- Batteries can cause harm if not handled properly.
- Only 3.7-4.2&nbsp;V Rechargeable LiPo batteries are supported. It is highly recommended not to use other types of batteries with the system unless you know what you are doing.
- If a non-rechargeable battery is used, it has to be unplugged first before connecting the USB cable to the USB port of the board to configure the device. Not doing so might damage the battery or cause a fire.
- Only 5&nbsp;V solar panels are supported. Do not use 12&nbsp;V solar panels. It will destroy the charging unit and eventually other electronic parts.
- Make sure the battery wires match the polarity on the WisBlock Base board. Not all batteries have the same wiring.

### Software Configuration and Example

#### Initial Test of the RAK12011 WisBlock Module

1. Install the [RAKwireless Arduino BSP's for WisBlock](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index) by using the `package_rakwireless_index.json` board installation package, the WisBlock Core should now be available on the Arduino IDE.

2. You need to select first the WisBlock Core you have, as shown in **Figure 6** to **Figure 8**.

    }
  }

  Serial.println("LPS33 Found!");

  g_lps22hb.setDataRate(LPS22_RATE_10_HZ);
  Serial.print("Data rate set to: ");

  switch (g_lps22hb.getDataRate()) 
  {
    case LPS22_RATE_ONE_SHOT: Serial.println("One Shot / Power Down"); 
      break;
    case LPS22_RATE_1_HZ: Serial.println("1 Hz"); 
      break;
    case LPS22_RATE_10_HZ: Serial.println("10 Hz"); 
      break;
    case LPS22_RATE_25_HZ: Serial.println("25 Hz"); 
      break;
    case LPS22_RATE_50_HZ: Serial.println("50 Hz"); 
      break;

  }
}

void loop() {
  sensors_event_t temp;
  sensors_event_t pressure;
  g_lps22hb.getEvent(&pressure, &temp);
  Serial.print("Temperature: ");Serial.print(temp.temperature);Serial.println(" degrees C");
  Serial.print("Pressure: ");Serial.print(pressure.pressure);Serial.println(" hPa");
  Serial.println("");
  delay(1000);
}

```

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you experience any error in compiling the example sketch, check the updated code for your WisBlock Core Module that can be found on the [RAK12011 WisBlock Example Code Repository](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/tree/master/examples/common/sensors/RAK12011_MEMS_Pressure_LPS33HW) and this sample code in Github will work on all WisBlock Core.
:::

4. Once the example code is open, install the [Adafruit LPS2X](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_LPS2X) library by clicking the yellow highlighted link, as shown in **Figure 9** and **Figure 10**.

5. After successful installation of the library, you can now select the right serial port and upload the code, as shown in **Figure 11** and **Figure 12**.

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you're using the RAK11200 as your WisBlock Core, the RAK11200 requires the **Boot0** pin to be configured properly first before uploading. If not done properly, uploading the source code to RAK11200 will fail. Check the full details on the [RAK11200 Quick Start Guide](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK11200/Quickstart/#uploading-to-wisblock).

6. When you successfully uploaded the example sketch, open the Serial Monitor of the Arduino IDE to see the sensor's reading logs. If you see the logs, as shown in **Figure 13**, then your RAK12011 is properly communicating to the WisBlock core.
