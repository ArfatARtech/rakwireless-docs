# RAK19011 WisBlock Dual IO Base Board with Power Slot Datasheet

## WisBlock Dual IO Base Board with Power Slot Overview

**RAK19011** is a **WisBlock Dual IO Base Board with Power Slot** board that connects **WisBlock Core**, **Wisblock Power**, and **WisBlock Modules**. It has one slot reserved for the WisBlock Core module, one slot for the Wisblock Power module, two IO slots, and six sensor slots A to F for WisBlock Modules. Also, there are two **2.54&nbsp;mm pitch headers** that expose all key input-output pins of the WisBlock Core including UART, I2C, SPI, and many IO Pins.

WisBlock Modules are connected to the RAK19011 WisBlock Dual IO Base Board with Power Slot via **high-speed board-to-board connectors**. They provide secure and reliable interconnection to ensure the signal integrity of each data bus. A set of screws are used for fixing the modules, which makes it reliable even in an environment with lots of vibrations. Additionally, it has a user-defined button.

If you can't find a module that fits your IoT requirements, use the standard connectors of WisBlock to develop your specific function module. WisBlock supports open-source hardware architecture and you can find tutorials showing how to create your own [Awesome WisBlock](https://github.com/RAKWireless/Awesome-WisBlock) module.

##### J19 and J20 Headers (Core IO Pins)

On the WisBlock Dual IO Base board with power slot, there are a total of 40 2.54&nbsp;mm pitch headers for IO access and extension. These IO pins are distributed to J10 and J15 pin headers with the corresponding label at the back of the board. The arrangement of the pins is based on the [40-pin WisConnector of the WisBlock Core](#connector-for-wisblock-core).

:::tip üìù NOTE
BOOT pin is used on startup configuration or sequence of the WisBlock Core connected to it. It is commonly used for uploading the bootloader and/or application firmware. The requirements of the state of the BOOT pin depend on the specific model of the WisBlock Core used.

##### Connectors for WisBlock Sensor

The WisBlock sensor module connector is a 24-pin board-to-board connector.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏èWARNING
The WisBlock 24-pin connectors have the same connections for **3V3_S**, **GND**, **I2C**, and **SPI**. However, **UART** and **IO** pins are not the same for all slots.

#### Electrical Characteristics

##### Absolute Maximum Ratings

The Absolute Maximum Ratings of the device are shown in the table below. The stress ratings are the functional operation of the device.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏èWARNING
1. If the stress rating goes above what is listed, it may cause permanent damage to the device.
2. Exposure to maximum rating conditions may affect the device reliability.
:::

| Ratings                                 | Maximum Value   | Unit |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------- | ---- |
| IOs of WisConnector                     | ‚Äì0.3 to VDD+0.3 | V    |
| ESD                                     | 2000            | V    |

:::tip üìù NOTE
The RAK19011, like any electronic equipment, is sensitive to **electrostatic discharge (ESD)**. Improper handling can cause permanent damage to the module.
:::

##### Current Consumption

The RAK19011 is designed for **low-power IoT products**. Its power supply uses a high-efficiency low ground current regulator. When there is no module on RAK19011, the **leakage current is lower than 2&nbsp;¬µA**. With WisBlock Core and WisBlock sensor on it, the sleep current is **lower than 10&nbsp;¬µA**. When a LoRa module is transmitting, the current may reach **130&nbsp;mA**.

| **Conditions**                                                      | **Current** | **Unit** |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Leakage current, without any module on RAK19011                     | 2           | ¬µA       |
| Idle current, with WisBlock Core and WisBlock Modules in sleep mode | 10          | ¬µA       |
| Working current, with LoRa module transmitting                      | 130         | mA       |
