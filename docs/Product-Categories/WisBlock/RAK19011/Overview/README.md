## Product Description

**RAK19011** is a **WisBlock Dual IO Base Board with Power Slot** board that connects **WisBlock Core**, **Wisblock Power**, and **WisBlock Modules**. It has one slot reserved for the WisBlock Core module, one slot for the Wisblock Power module, two IO slots, and six sensor slots A to F for WisBlock Modules. Also, there are two **2.54&nbsp;mm pitch headers** that expose all key input-output pins of the WisBlock Core including UART, I2C, SPI, and many IO Pins.

WisBlock Modules are connected to the RAK19011 WisBlock Dual IO Base Board with Power Slot via **high-speed board-to-board connectors**. They provide secure and reliable interconnection to ensure the signal integrity of each data bus. A set of screws are used for fixing the modules, which makes it reliable even in an environment with lots of vibrations. Additionally, it has a user-defined button.

## Product Features

* Flexible building block design, which enables modular functionality and expansion

* **Size**    
    * 60 x 67&nbsp;mm


## Prerequisites 

RAK19011 WisBlock Dual IO Base Board with Power Slot is easy-to-use and requires a **WisBlock Core**, **WisBlock Power Module**, and **WisBlock Modules** to start developing with the system. 

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

- RAK19011 requires a WisBlock Power Module to have power and connector interfaces. There is no USB and battery/power connector in RAK19011. These functionalities must be added by attaching correct WisBlock Power Module for the application.
- Make sure to fix the modules with the screws to ensure a proper function.
