## Assembly Guide

### 1. Prepare the Lid and Gasket

First, install the rubber gasket in the groove of the top cover, as shown in **Figure 2**. Put the four corners of the gasket into the groove, and then press the middle gently. Ensure that the gasket is not twisted. 

Before assembly, check if the gasket is installed correctly. The rubber gasket helps seal the enclosure properly and protects it from dust and water.

### 2. Choose the Internal Mounting Plate

Next is to prepare the mounting plate. There are two types of mounting plates:

- Plain mounting plate
- WisBlock bespoke mounting plate 

#### Plain Mounting Plate

The plain mounting plate has no holes, except on mounting holes to the enclosure. It is designed to be customized depending on the circuit board to be placed in the enclosure.

#### WisBlock Bespoke Mounting Plate

The WisBlock Bespoke Mounting Plate is designed specifically to hold WisBlock Base boards. You have to cut the excess bosses or parts with a wire cutter depending on the WisBlock Base board that you have.

The following guide shows what to cut depending on the WisBlock Base board.

## Mounting Guide

After full assembly of the enclosure, the next step is to choose the right mounting accessory for your application:

- [Pole Mount](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAKBox-UO100x75x38/Installation/#pole-mounting)
- [Wall Mount](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAKBox-UO100x75x38/Installation/#wall-mounting)

Each mount accessory has a mark indicated by a capital letter, as shown in **Figure 11**, and each WisBlock Unify Enclosure has several fixed positions, which are indicated by a mark of numerals, as shown in **Figure 12**. The small-sized WisBlock Unify Enclosure has only four (4) fixed positions.

| Size  |   Fix Position    |
| :---: | :---------------: |
| Small | 1 & 3  <br> 2 & 4 |



3. Lastly, follow the steps below, as also shown in **Figure 18**:

- **Step 1**: Use a Œ¶5&nbsp;mm drill head to drill holes in the wall. Drill at least 55-60&nbsp;mm in depth.
- **Step 2**: Plug the screw anchors onto the drilled holes. You can use a hammer to plug it in. It helps the screws to have a secure fit on the wall. 
- **Step 3**: Fix the WisBlock Unify Enclosure on the wall using two (2) pieces of st3.5*35&nbsp;mm tapping screws.
