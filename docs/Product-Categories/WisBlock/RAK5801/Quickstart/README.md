# RAK5801 Quick Start Guide

## Prerequisite

### What Do You Need?

Before going through each and every step on using the RAK5801 WisBlock module, make sure to prepare the necessary items listed below:

#### Hardware

- [RAK5801 WisBlock 4-20mA Interface Board](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak5801-4-20ma-interface?utm_source=RAK5801&utm_medium=Document&utm_campaign=BuyFromStore)
- [WisBlock Base](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-base/)
- Your choice of [WisBlock Core](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-core)
- USB Cable
- [Li-Ion/LiPo battery (optional)](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-accessory/products/battery-connector-cable?utm_source=BatteryConnector&utm_medium=Document&utm_campaign=BuyFromStore)
- [Solar charger (optional)](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-accessory/products/solar-panel-connector-cable?utm_source=SolarPanelConnector&utm_medium=Document&utm_campaign=BuyFromStore)

#### Software

##### Arduino

- You need to download and install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
- To add the RAKwireless Core boards on your Arduino Boards Manager, install the [RAKwireless Arduino BSP](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index).

## Product Configuration

### Block Diagram

The RAK5801 module was designed to convert 4-20&nbsp;mA current signals into voltage signals by applying a sampling resistor. As shown in **Figure 1**, the input current signal from the sensor is conditioned by an operational amplifier to match the level supported by the ADC input of an MCU where the signal is digitized.


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak5801/quickstart/rak5801_block_diagram.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="RAK5801 Block Diagram"
/>

Once the signal is digitalized, the user can recover the original current value by applying the following formula:

``I = U/149``

Where **U** is the ADC reading and **I** is the sensor current.

As shown in **Figure 1**, the module provides an output of 12&nbsp;V for powering passive 4-20&nbsp;mA sensors. This 12&nbsp;V output is boosted by an internal DC-DC booster. The enable pin allows to control the power conversion module and set the RAK5801 module into a low-power consumption mode.

### Hardware Setup

The RAK5801 is a 4-20&nbsp;mA current loop extension module that allows you to make an IoT solution for analog sensors with 4-20&nbsp;mA interface. This module converts the 4-20&nbsp;mA current signal into voltage range supported by the WisBlock Core module for further digitalization and data transmission. This module integrates a 12&nbsp;V power supply, which can be used to power external sensors. The RAK5801 can be connected to 2-wire, 3-wire, or 4-wire types of 4-20&nbsp;mA sensor. For more information about RAK5801, refer to the [Datasheet](../Datasheet/).

#### Installation

##### Mounting Mechanism

The RAK5801 module is part of the WisBlock Interface category, which connects to the baseboard through the IO slot. The installation method is shown in **Figure 2** and **Figure 3**.

1. Keep the RAK5801 module parallel to the baseboard, and gently place and plug WisConnector into the IO slot receptacle of the baseboard. The IO slot has an outer silkscreen on it to assist with the alignment. At this point, apply force evenly along with the module and press again. There will be a sound to confirm the successful completion of the attachment process.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
For detailed instructions, refer to the [WisBlock Installation Guide](/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK5005-O-Baseboard-Installation-Guide/).

2. Always secure the RAK5801 module with **3 x M1.2 x3 pan head screws**, as shown in **Figure 3**.

  width="50%"
  caption="RAK5801 mounting mechanism on a WisBlock Base module"
/>

##### RAK5801 Fast Crimping Terminal Mechanism

The RAK5801 features a fast-crimping terminal connector to simplify and ensure the wiring process on the fields. The fast-crimping terminal can support cable with a width between 20 AWG to 24 AWG. The usual stripping length is around 6 to 7&nbsp;mm.

As shown in **Figure 4**, during the crimping process, you should first press down and maintain the spring head of the crimping terminal firmly, then insert the stripped cable head into the corresponding connector‚Äôs hole. Once inserted correctly, then release the spring head, and the crimping process is completed.

##### Disassembling Procedure

The procedure in disassembling any type of WisBlock module is the same.

1. First, remove the screws.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak5801/quickstart/removing_screw.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Removing screws from the WisBlock module"
/>

2. Once the screws are removed, check the silkscreen of the module to find the correct location where force can be applied.

3. Apply force to the module at the position of the connector, as shown in **Figure 7**, to detach the module from the baseboard.

#### Typical Application

##### Two-Wire sensor

Two-wire transmitters are energized by the current loop, where the supply voltage is included in the receptor. The transmitter is floating and the ground is in the receptor.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak5801/quickstart/rak5801_2wire.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="RAK5801 with 2-wire/4-20mA sensor."
/>

##### Three-Wire Sensor

Three-wire transmitters have three wires powered by the source voltage in them. In this case, the transmitter is the power source for the current loop. The transmitter common is connected to the common of the receptor.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak5801/quickstart/rak5801_3wire.png"
  width="50%"
  caption="RAK5801 with 3-wire/4-20mA sensor."
/>

##### Four-Wire Sensor

Four-wire transmitters have four wires powered by the source voltage in them. The transmitter powers the current loop and the receptor acts as a floating load.

Now, you can connect the battery (optional) and USB cable to start programming your WisBlock Core.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
- Batteries can cause harm if not handled properly.
- Only 3.7-4.2&nbsp;V Rechargeable LiPo batteries are supported. It is highly recommended not to use other types of batteries with the system unless you know what you are doing.
- If a non-rechargeable battery is used, it has to be unplugged first before connecting the USB cable to the USB port of the board to configure the device. Not doing so might damage the battery or cause a fire.
- Only 5&nbsp;V solar panels are supported. Do not use 12&nbsp;V solar panels. It will destroy the charging unit and eventually other electronic parts.
- Make sure the battery wires are matching the polarity on the WisBlock Base board. Not all batteries have the same wiring.
:::

### Software Configuration and Example

The RAK5801 module includes a 12&nbsp;V voltage source which is controlled by the WisBlock Core module via IO1 (WB_IO1) of the WisBlock Base. This GPIO must be set to **HIGH** before sampling. The 12&nbsp;V voltage source is designed to provide power supply to 4-20&nbsp;mA sensors. The majority of 4-20&nbsp;mA sensor works in the 9-24&nbsp;V range. Before connecting a sensor to the RAK5801 module, you must be sure that the sensor can safely operate at 12&nbsp;V.

For RAK5801, the accessible ADC pin assignments are defined as follows in the Arduino IDE:

- `WB_IO4` for AIN0, ADC Input pin
- `WB_A1` for AIN1, ADC Input pin

::: tip üìù NOTE
- **WB_IO4** for AIN0 only works for the RAK4631 core module.
- If you will be using the RAK11200 core module, there are few hardware modifications needed to configure. Check the [Pin Definition](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK5801/Datasheet/#hardware) section in the Datasheet.
