## Product Description

RAK12029 is a metal detection sensor module based on the LDC1614 from Texas Instruments. The LDC1614 is an inductance-to-digital converter (LDC) that measures the oscillation frequency of four LC resonators. It outputs a digital value, that is, proportional to frequency, with 28 bits of measurement resolution. With this digital value, you can detect the presence of metallic objects.


## Product Features

* Metal detection module
* Sensing coils up to four channels
* 28-bit LDC
* Immunity to DC magnetic fields and magnets
* 3.3&nbsp;V Power supply
* Operating Current: 0.2&nbsp;uA to 2.1&nbsp;mA
* Chipset: Texas Instruments LDC1614
* **Module size**: 25 x 35&nbsp;mm

## Prerequisites

To use a **RAK12029**, you need at least a **WisBlock Base** to plug the module in. The **WisBlock Base** should have a connected battery to provide power supply to the **RAK12029** module. Furthermore, you need a **WisBlock Core** module to use the sensor.
