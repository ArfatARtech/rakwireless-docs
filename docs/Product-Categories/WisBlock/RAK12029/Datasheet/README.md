### Description

RAK12029 is a metal detection sensor module based on the LDC1614 from Texas Instruments. The LDC1614 is an inductance-to-digital converter (LDC) that measures the oscillation frequency of four LC resonators. It outputs a digital value, that is, proportional to frequency, with 28 bits of measurement resolution. With this digital value, you can detect the presence of metallic objects.


### Features 

* Metal detection module
* Sensing coils up to four channels
* 28-bit LDC
* Immunity to DC magnetic fields and magnets
* 3.3&nbsp;V Power supply
* Operating Current: 0.2&nbsp;uA to 2.1&nbsp;mA
* Chipset: Texas Instruments LDC1614
* **Module size**: 25 x 35&nbsp;mm

## Specifications
### Overview

#### Mounting

The RAK12029 WisBlock Inductive Sensor Module can be mounted to the IO slot of the [WisBlock Base](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/#wisblock-base) board. **Figure 2** shows the mounting mechanism of the RAK12029 on a WisBlock Base module.

### Hardware

The hardware specification is categorized into five parts. It shows the chipset of the module and discusses the pinouts and their corresponding functions and diagrams. It also covers the electrical and mechanical characteristics that include the tabular data of the functionalities and standard values of the RAK12029 WisBlock Inductive Sensor Module.


####  Chipset

| Vendor            | Part number |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| Texas Instruments | LDC1614     |

#### Pin Definition

The RAK12029 WisBlock Inductive Sensor comprises a standard WisBlock connector. The WisBlock connector allows the RAK12029 module to be mounted to a WisBlock Base board. The pin order of the connector and the pinout definition is shown in **Figure 3**.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
* **I2C** related pin, **3V3_S**, and **GND** are connected to WisIO connector.
* **SD (WB_IO5)** is shutdown mode pin. High input voltage configures the module to shutdown mode.
* **INT (WB_IO6)** is a configurable interrupt output pin from the LDC1614.

#### Schematic Diagram

##### Power Supply Circuit

**Figure 6** shows the RAK12029 power supply circuit. 

* **3V3_S** supply voltage comes from the WisBlock Base board (max voltage: 3.6&nbsp;V).
* **VDD** is the supply voltage going to the module (max voltage: 3.6&nbsp;V).

##### Inductive Sensor Circuit

**Figure 7** shows the inductive sensor circuit.

* **U1** is the LDC1614 Inductance to Digital Converter (LDC) chip.
* **P1**, **P2**, **P3**, and **P4** are the connectors for the four sensing coils. The four channels are independent of each other. You can choose how many coils to connect. About the coil, RAK provides one type of coil as an accessory. If you need to design your own coil, you can read the [LDC Reference Coils User‚Äôs Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/ug/snou136/snou136.pdf?ts=1645630492668&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F) from Texas Instruments.

##### I2C Circuit

The I2C interface of the RAK12029 is shown in **Figure 8**. The pull-up resistors are not populated because the needed pull-up resistors are already in the WisBlock Base board.
