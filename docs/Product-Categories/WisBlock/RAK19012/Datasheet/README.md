##### LEDs

Three LEDs are used to indicate the operating status. Below are the functions of the LEDs:

- üî¥ **Red LED** - Connected to the charger chip to indicate the charger status. When the battery is charging, this red LED is on. When the battery is full, this LED is weak light or off.
- üü¢ **Green LED** - Connected to the MCU module, controlled by MCU defined by the user.
- üîµ **Blue LED** - Connected to the MCU module, controlled by MCU defined by the user.

##### RESET Push Button

The Reset Push Button, as shown in [**Figure 3**](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK19012/Datasheet/#interfaces), is connected to the MCU module. When pushed, it resets the MCU.

#### Pin Definition

The RAK19012 module has a 40-pin WisConnector that is compatible with the WisBlock Power Slot. The pin order of the connector and the pinout definition is shown in **Figure 5**.

::: tip üìù NOTE
VBAT, 3V3, RESET, LED1, LED2, ADC_VBAT, and GND are connected to the WisIO connector.
