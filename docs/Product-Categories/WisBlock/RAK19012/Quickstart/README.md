#### Software

##### Arduino

- Download and install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
- To add the RAKwireless Core boards to your Arduino Boards Manager, install the [RAKwireless Arduino BSP](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index).

## Product Configuration

### Hardware Setup

RAK19012 should be attached to the power slot connector of WisBlock Base board with power slot. It is a power board that provides the same features and interfaces that standard WisBlock Base boards provide - USB C connector, battery and solar panel connector, LED indicators, and reset button.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

RAK19012 **only** supports WisBlock Base boards with Power Slot. It is not compatible with all WisBlock Base boards.

:::

For more information about RAK19012, refer to the [Datasheet](../Datasheet/).

#### Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules

##### Assembling Procedure

RAK19012 module can be mounted on the power slot of the WisBlock Base board, as shown in **Figure 2**. Also, always secure the connection of the WisBlock module by using compatible screws.

##### Disassembling Procedure

The procedure in disassembling any type of WisBlock module is the same.

1. First, remove the screws.

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you will connect other modules to the remaining WisBlock Base slots, check on the [WisBlock Pin Mapper](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Pin-Mapper/) tool for possible conflicts.

##### Rechargeable Battery

RAK19012 can be powered by a rechargeable Li-Ion/LiPo battery via the dedicated connectors, as shown in **Figure 6**. The matching connector for the rechargeable battery wires is a [JST PHR-2 2&nbsp;mm pitch female](https://www.jst-mfg.com/product/detail_e.php?series=199). A cable assembly for the rechargeable battery connector is also available for purchase in [RAK store](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/battery-connector-cable).

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

- Battery can cause harm if not handled properly.
- Only 3.7-4.2&nbsp;V Rechargeable LiPo batteries are supported. It is highly recommended not to use other types of batteries with the system unless you know what you are doing.
- Make sure the battery wires, both rechargeable and non-rechargeable, match the polarity on the RAK19012 board. Not all batteries have the same wiring.

:::

#### Solar Panel Connection

The battery can be recharged, as well, via a small Solar Panel, as shown in **Figure 6**. The matching connector for the solar panel wires is an [JST ZHR-2 1.5&nbsp;mm pitch female](https://www.jst-mfg.com/product/detail_e.php?series=287). A cable assembly for the solar panel connector is also available for purchase in [RAK store](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/solar-panel-connector-cable).


:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

- Only 5&nbsp;V solar panels are supported. Do not use 12&nbsp;V solar panels. It will destroy the charging unit and eventually other electronic parts.
- The GND pin of the solar panel connector is located on edge of the board. Make sure the solar panel wires match the polarity on the RAK19012 board.

### Software Setup

There is no software required to use RAK19012. But to control the two user LEDs and monitor the battery voltage, they must be attached to a WisBlock Base and WisBlock Core.

#### WisBlock Examples Repository

To quickly build your IoT device with less hassle, example codes for WisBlock Core are provided. You can access the codes on the [WisBlock Example code repository](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/tree/master/examples). The example codes on folder `common` are compatible with RAK4631, RAK11200, and RAK11310 WisBlock Cores.
The two user LEDs of RAK19012 can be accessed using macrodefinitions `LED_GREEN` / `PIN_LED1` for the green LED and `LED_BLUE` / `PIN_LED2` for the blue LED. For the battery voltage reading, `WB_A0` is used.
