# RAK16002 WisBlock Coulomb Sensor Module Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

RAK16002 is a Coulomb sensor module based on LTC2941IDCB that features programmable high and low thresholds for the accumulated charge. If a threshold is exceeded, the device communicates an alert by setting a flag in the internal status register. It can measure the battery charge state in battery-powered IoT devices. Its operating range is perfectly suited for single-cell Li-Ion batteries. 

The precision coulomb counter integrates current through an internal sense resistor between the battery‚Äôs positive terminal and the load or charger. The measured charge is stored in internal registers. An I2C interface accesses and configures the device.

### Applications

  * Low power IoT products
  * Indoor environment sensors
  * Air quality sensors
