## Product Description

The RAK14001 is an RGB LED module that can be mounted to the IO slot of the WisBlock Base board. It is capable of driving RGB LEDs with up to 20&nbsp;mA per segment via the I2C interface. The main component of this module is the NCP5623B from On Semiconductors. This IC has a built‚àíin DC/DC converter that works as a high-efficiency charge pump providing the required DC voltage for all three LED segments. There is also an **IREF** pin that provides the reference current based on the internal band‚àígap voltage reference to control the output current flowing in the LED.

## Product Features

* **Module specifications**
    * 2.7&nbsp;V - 4.2&nbsp;V input voltage range
    * RGB Function Fully Supported
    * Programmable Integrated Gradual Dimming
    * Support I2C Protocol
    * Support enable power supply 

* **Size**
    * 25 x 35&nbsp;mm

## Prerequisites

To use a **RAK14001**, you need at least a **WisBlock Base** to plug the module in. **WisBlock Base** is the power supply for the **RAK14001** module. Furthermore, you need a **WisBlock Core** module to use the sensor.
