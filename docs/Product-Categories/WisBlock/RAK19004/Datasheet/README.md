# RAK19004 WisBlock Green Power Module Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

RAK19004 is a WisBlock Power module that can harness and convert green power such as wind power, hydroelectric power, or solar power into fixed 5&nbsp;V output. The module uses a TPS55165-Q1 from Texas Instruments, which is a DC-DC buck-boost converter. Upon startup, the module can have a stable 5&nbsp;V output from a varying input voltage of 2&nbsp;V-36&nbsp;V, and its output current can also be as high as 1&nbsp;A.

::: tip üìù NOTE
- The module has a minimum input voltage of 5.3&nbsp;V for a startup.
- RAK19004 doesn't have a WisConnector just like the other WisBlock modules, but it is an external module with four (4) mounting holes, so you can place the module in the position that you want.
::: 

### Features

- 5&nbsp;V Power Output
- 2&nbsp;V-36&nbsp;V Power Input
- Module size: 15 X 25&nbsp;mm

## Specifications

### Overview

#### Mounting

The RAK19004 is an external module with four (4) mounting holes, so you can place or mount the module in the position that you want.
