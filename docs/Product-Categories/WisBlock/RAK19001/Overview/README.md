## Product Description


**RAK19001** is a **WisBlock Base** board that connects **WisBlock Core** and **WisBlock Modules**. It provides the power supply and interconnection to the modules attached to it. It has one slot reserved for the WisBlock Core module, two IO slots, and six sensor slots A to F for WisBlock Modules. Also, there are two **2.54&nbsp;mm pitch headers** that expose all key input-output pins of the WisBlock Core that includes UART, I2C, SPI, and many IO Pins.

For convenience, there is a Type-C USB connector that is connected directly to WisBlock Core MCU‚Äôs USB port (if supported) or to a USB-UART converter depending on the WisBlock Core. The USB-C connection can be used for uploading firmware, serial communication, and charging a rechargeable battery. RAK19001 also includes a slide switch to select between rechargeable and non-rechargeable batteries.

WisBlock Modules are connected to the RAK19001 WisBlock Base board via **high-speed board-to-board connectors**. They provide secure and reliable interconnection to ensure the signal integrity of each data bus. A set of screws are used for fixing the modules, which makes it reliable even in an environment with lots of vibrations.

Additionally, it has two user-definable LEDs, one power supply/charging indicator LED, and one user-defined button.

## Prerequisites

RAK19001 WisBlock Dual IO Base Board is easy-to-use and requires only a Type-C USB cable to start developing with the system.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
- On rechargeable batteries, only 3.7-4.2&nbsp;V rechargeable Li-Ion batteries are supported. Do not use other types of rechargeable batteries with the system.
- On non-rechargeable batteries, the ideal range is 3.3 to 5.5&nbsp;V.
- Only 5&nbsp;V solar panels (up to 6&nbsp;V) are supported. Do not use 12&nbsp;V solar panels. It will destroy the charging unit and eventually other electronic parts.
