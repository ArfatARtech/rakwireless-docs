# RAK18040 WisBlock Audio Analog Microphone to I2S Module Datasheet

## Overview


### Description

**RAK18040** is an analog microphone to the I2S module, part of the **WisBlock Audio Series**. With an analog microphone, analog audio can be directed to I2S output using this module. RAK18040 is designed based on **NAU85L40B** from Nuvoton. **NAU85L40B** is an audio ADC with an integrated frequency-locked loop (FLL) and microphone preamplifier.

### Features

### Hardware

The hardware specification is categorized into five (5) parts. It shows the chipset of the module and discusses the pinouts and their corresponding functions and diagrams. It also covers the acoustics, electrical, and mechanical characteristics that include the tabular data of the functionalities and standard values of the RAK18040 WisBlock Audio Analog Microphone to I2S Module.

#### Chipset

| Vendor  | Part Number |
| :-----: | :---------: |
| Nuvoton |  NAU85L40B  |

#### Pin Definition

RAK18040 has two board-to-board (BTB) connectors, one for the interposer board and another for the amplifier board.

::: tip üìù NOTE
- **3V3**, **VBAT**, **VBUS**, and **GND** are power supply pins from the interposer board.
- **Device_I2C_SDA** and **Device_I2C_SCL** are interfaces between NAU85L40B and **WisBlock Core**.
- **AMIC_I2S_BCLK**, **AMIC_I2S_WS**, **AMIC_I2S_DI**, and **AMIC_I2S_DO** are I2S signals.
- **MIC_CTR_IO1** and **MIC_CTR_IO2** are GPIOs from the interposer board used as control signals for reserved analog microphones.

##### Stack Connector for Amplifier Board

The RAK18040 WisBlock module comprises a female board-to-board (BTB) connector. The BTB connector allows the RAK18040 module to be stacked with an amplifier board, such as RAK18060. The pin order of the connector and the pinout definition is shown in **Figure 5**.

/>

::: tip üìù NOTE
- **3V3**, **VBAT**, **VBUS**, and **GND** are power supply pins for the amplifier board.
- **AMP_CTR_IO1** is the GPIO from the interposer board. Normally, this pin is **HIGH**. It will be **LOW** if there is an error within the amplifier.
- **AMIC_I2S_DO**, **AMIC_I2S_DI**, **AMIC_I2S_WS**, and **AMIC_I2S_BCLK** are I2S signals to the amplifier board.
- **Device_I2C_SDA** and **Device_I2C_SCL** are I2C signals used to control the amplifier board.
- **AMP_Check** is a GPIO pin. It is used to check whether an Amplifier board is connected. This pin is **LOW** when there is no amplifier board and will be **HIGH** when an amplifier board is connected.
