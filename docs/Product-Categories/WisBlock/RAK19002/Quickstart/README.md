# RAK19002 Quick Start Guide

<!--
## Introduction

This guide introduces the RAK19002 Wisblock Boost board and how to use and program with it.

-->

## Prerequisite

### What Do You Need?

Before going through each and every step on using RAK19002 WisBlock module, make sure to prepare the necessary items listed below:

#### Hardware

- [RAK19002 WisBlock Boost Board](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/wisblock-boost-module-rak19002)
- Your choice of [WisBlock Base](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-base) 
- Your choice of [WisBlock Core](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-core)
- USB Cable
- [Li-Ion/LiPo battery (optional)](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-accessory/products/battery-connector-cable)
- [Solar charger (optional)](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-accessory/products/solar-panel-connector-cable)

#### Software

- Download and install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
- To add the RAKwireless Core boards on your Arduino Boards Manager, install the [RAKwireless Arduino BSP](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index).

## Product Configuration

### Hardware Setup

The RAK19002 is a step-up boost regulator module, part of the RAKwireless WisBlock Series. The module can supply 12&nbsp;V / 50&nbsp;mA and could be mounted on WisSensor slot of RAK5005-O. The output voltage of the module is controlled by WisBlock Core IO pin.

For more information about RAK19002, refer to the [Datasheet](../Datasheet/).

RAK19002 module can be connected to **Slot A, B, C, or D** of WisBlock Base to communicate with the WisBlock Core. It will work on any of those slots, but you need to consider the specific pin assigned on that slot to use the RAK19002. The table below shows the default IO pins used:

| SLOT A | SLOT B | SLOT C | SLOT D |
| :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
|  IO1   |  IO2   |  IO3   |  IO5   |

Also, always secure the connection of the WisBlock module by using the compatible screws, as shown in **Figure 1**.

#### Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules

##### Assembling

As shown in **Figure 3**, the location for Slot A, B, C, and D are properly marked by silkscreen. Follow carefully the procedure defined in [RAK5005-O module assembly/disassembly instructions](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK5005-O-Baseboard-Installation-Guide/) to attach a WisBlock module. Once attached, carefully fix the module with one or more pieces of M1.2 x 3&nbsp;mm screws depending on the module.

  caption="Module connection to WisBlock Base"
/>

##### Disassembling

The procedure in disassembling any type of WisBlock modules is the same. 

1. First, remove the screws.

  width="70%"
  caption="Removing screws from the WisBlock module"
/>

2. Once the screws are removed, check the silkscreen of the module to find the correct location where force can be applied.

3. Apply force to the module at the position of the connector, as shown in **Figure 6**, to detach the module from the baseboard.

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you will connect other modules to remaining WisBlock Base slots, check on the [WisBlock Pin Mapper](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Pin-Mapper/) tool for possible conflicts. 
:::


After all this setup, you can now connect the battery (optional) and USB cable to start programming your WisBlock Core.

### Software Configuration and Example

For RAK19002, the default accessible IO pin assignments are defined as follows which are used on different connection slots:

- `WB_IO1` for IO1 on **SLOT A**
- `WB_IO2` for IO2 on **SLOT B**
- `WB_IO3` for IO3 on **SLOT C**
- `WB_IO5` for IO5 on **SLOT D**

::: tip üìù NOTE
- The IO pin MUST be set to **HIGH** to enable the RAK19002 Boost module.
- The **SLOT B** is not recommended because the IO2 pin is used to control power supply 3V3_S on RAK5005-O WisBase.
- The maximum recommended current is 50&nbsp;mA  ( V<sub>IN</sub>=3.3&nbsp;V ).
