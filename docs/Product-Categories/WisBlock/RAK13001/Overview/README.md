## Product Description

RAK13001 is a WisBlock Interface module which extends the WisBlock system to be used on isolated digital input and output applications. There is one digital output that is isolated by an electromechanical relay and one digital input isolated by an opto-couple. The isolated input can be configurated as wet contact (default mode) or dry contact. RAK13001 digital output is used to programmatically switch on/off devices operating at high voltage or current applications.
