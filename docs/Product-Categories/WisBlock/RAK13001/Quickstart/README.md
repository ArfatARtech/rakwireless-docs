#### Software

##### Arduino

- You need to download and install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
- To add the RAKwireless Core boards on your Arduino Boards Manager, install the [RAKwireless Arduino BSP](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index).

## Product Configuration

### Block Diagram

The RAK13001 uses one relay to isolate the output of MCU. The dielectric strength between coil and contacts of a relay is 4000&nbsp;VAC 1min.

For input, RAK13001 uses an opto-couple as isolation, and it supports wet contact as default. The rating of input is 12&nbsp;V-24&nbsp;VDC. It also can be configured as dry contact by reworking some resistors on the PCB module as instructed in the [datasheet](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK13001/Datasheet/#hardware). The relay has a maximum rating of 130&nbsp;VAC / 30&nbsp;VDC.

### Hardware Setup

RAK13001 is a WisBlock Interface module that extends the WisBlock system to be used on isolated digital input and output applications. There is one digital output that is isolated by an electromechanical relay which is used to programmatically switch on/off devices operating at high voltage or current applications and one digital input isolated by an opto-couple. The isolated input can be configured as wet contact (default mode) or dry contact.

For more information about RAK13001, refer to the [Datasheet](../Datasheet/).

#### Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules

##### Assembling Procedure

The RAK13001 module can be mounted on the IO slot of the WisBlock Base board as shown in **Figure 4**. Also, always secure the connection of the WisBlock module by using compatible screws.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak13001/quickstart/mounting-mechanism.png"
  width="60%"
  caption="RAK13001 mounting connection to WisBlock Base module"
/>

##### RAK13001 Connector Crimping Mechanism

The RAK13001 features a fast-crimping terminal connector to simplify and ensure the wiring process on the fields. The fast-crimping terminal can support cable with a width between 20&nbsp;AWG to 24&nbsp;AWG. The usual stripping length is around 6 to 7&nbsp;mm.

As shown in **Figure 5**, during the crimping process, you should first press down and maintain the spring head of the crimping terminal firmly, then insert the stripped cable head into the corresponding connector‚Äôs hole. Once inserted correctly, release the spring head, and the crimping process is completed.

  width="40%"
  caption="RAK13001 Module Connector"
/>

##### Disassembling Procedure

The procedure in disassembling any type of WisBlock modules is the same.

1. First, remove the screws.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak13001/quickstart/16.removing-screws.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Removing screws from the WisBlock module"
/>

2. Once the screws are removed, check the silkscreen of the module to find the correct location where force can be applied.

  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak13001/quickstart/17.detaching-silkscreen.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Detaching silkscreen on the WisBlock module"
/>

3. Apply force to the module at the position of the connector, as shown in **Figure 8**, to detach the module from the baseboard.

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you will connect other modules to the remaining WisBlock Base slots, check on the [WisBlock Pin Mapper](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Pin-Mapper/) tool for possible conflicts.
:::

Now, you can connect the battery (optional) and USB cable to start programming your WisBlock Core.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
- Batteries can cause harm if not handled properly.
- Only 3.7-4.2&nbsp;V Rechargeable LiPo batteries are supported. It is highly recommended not to use other types of batteries with the system unless you know what you are doing.
- If a non-rechargeable battery is used, it has to be unplugged first before connecting the USB cable to the USB port of the board to configure the device. Not doing so might damage the battery or cause a fire.
- Only 5&nbsp;V solar panels are supported. Do not use 12&nbsp;V solar panels. It will destroy the charging unit and eventually other electronic parts.
- Make sure the battery wires are matching the polarity on the WisBlock Base board. Not all batteries have the same wiring.
:::

### Software Configuration and Example

In our example, you will be using the relay as wet contact. Before connecting high voltage modules to the RAK13001, make sure to follow safety precautions.

For RAK13001, the accessible pin assignments are defined as follows in the Arduino IDE:

- `WB_IO3` for Optocoupler Input pin
- `WB_IO4` for Relay Output pin

These are the quick links that go directly to the software guide for the specific WisBlock Core module you use:
