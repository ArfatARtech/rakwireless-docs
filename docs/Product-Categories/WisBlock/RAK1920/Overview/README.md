## Product Description

 
The RAK1920 module, a part of the WisBlock Interface series, is a sensor extension module, which extends the **WisBlock** system with an adapter board to connect Click Boards (MikroElektronika), QWICC (Sparkfun) based and Grove (Seeed) based sensors to **WisBlock**. This module was designed to be part of a production-ready IoT solution in a modular way and must be combined with a WisBlock Core and a Base module.  

It supports several defacto-standard interfaces in the IoT market and allows you to integrate sensors manufactured by Mikroe, SparkFun, SeeedStudio, and others. For example, the RAK1920 supports the Click Boards‚Ñ¢ series of modules provided by Mikroe, Qwiic Connect‚Ñ¢ sensor interface designed by SparkFun. Also, it supports all kinds of I2C module digital I/O, UART, and ADC sensors with a Grove‚Ñ¢ interface.


## Product Features

* **Module specifications**    
    * 1 Click Board compatible slot     
    * 1 Grove connector compatible with I2C and digital IO boards    
    * 1 Grove connector compatible with UART and analog IO boards     
    * Support for 5&nbsp;V Grove sensors up to 50&nbsp;mA  
    * 1 QWICC compatible connector    

* **Size**    
    * 30 x 36&nbsp;mm    

## Prerequisites

To use a **RAK1920**, you need at least a **WisBlock Base** to plug the module in. **WisBlock Base** is the power supply for the **RAK1920** module. Furthermore, you need a **WisBlock Core** module to use the sensor.  

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING    
Make sure to fix the module with the screws to ensure a proper function.
