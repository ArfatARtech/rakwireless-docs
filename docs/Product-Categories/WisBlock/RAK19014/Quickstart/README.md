#### Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules

##### Assembling Procedure

The RAK19014 WisBlock Battery USB Power Slot Module can be mounted on the Power Slot of the WisBlock Base board, as shown in **Figure 2**. Also, always secure the connection of the WisBlock module by using compatible screws.

##### Disassembling Procedure

The procedure in disassembling any type of WisBlock module is the same.

1. First, remove the screws.

#### Battery Connector

RAK19014 WisBlock Battery USB Power Slot Module can be powered by an external battery via the dedicated connectors, as shown in **Figure 6**. The matching connector for the battery cable is a [JST PHR-2 2&nbsp;mm pitch female](https://www.jst-mfg.com/product/detail_e.php?series=199). A cable assembly for the battery connector is also available for purchase in [RAK store](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/battery-connector-cable).

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

- Battery can cause harm if not handled properly.
- Make sure the battery wires match the polarity on the RAK19014 board. Not all batteries have the same wiring.

### Software Setup

The WisBlock Core is designed to be interfaced with other WisBlock Modules like sensors, displays, and other interfaces. To make useful devices, you need to upload a source code to the WisBlock Core.

Before you continue, you should have already set up either an [Arduino BSP](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index) or
[PlatformIO](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/blob/master/PlatformIO/README.md).

#### WisBlock Examples Repository

To quickly build your IoT device with less hassle, example codes for WisBlock Core are provided. You can access the codes on the [WisBlock Example code repository](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/tree/master/examples). The example codes on folder `common` are compatible with RAK4631, RAK11200, and RAK11310 WisBlock cores.
The two user LEDs of RAK19014 can be accessed using macro definitions `LED_GREEN` / `PIN_LED1` for the green LED and `LED_BLUE` / `PIN_LED2` for the blue LED.
