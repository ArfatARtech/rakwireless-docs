# RAK19014 WisBlock Battery USB Power Slot Module Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

The RAK19014 WisBlock Battery USB Power Slot Module is a modular power board comprises of a battery connector (no charging circuitry on-board) and a USB Type-C connector used for reprogramming the WisBlock Core. It is designed to be used with WisBlock Base Board with Power Slot via the 40-pin WisBlock connector.

RAK19014 is optimally designed to support very low-power applications since it only has a USB, battery connector, and 3.3&nbsp;V switching regulator in the circuit removing unnecessary components that cause extra current consumption.

### Features

- Designed for battery-only powered applications
- Support reprogramming of WisBlock Core via USB connector
- High-efficiency switching regulator
- Optimized for low-power devices
- Module size: 30 x 20&nbsp;mm

## Specifications

### Overview

#### Mounting

The RAK19014 module can be mounted on the Power slot of the WisBlock Base board. **Figure 1** shows the mounting mechanism of the RAK19014 on a WisBlock Base module, such as the RAK19010.

::: tip üìù NOTE
The voltage of the battery must not exceed 4.3&nbsp;V.
:::

##### LEDs

Two LEDs are used to indicate the operating status. Below are the functions of the LEDs:

- üü¢ **Green LED** - Connected to the MCU module, controlled by MCU defined by the user.
- üîµ **Blue LED** - Connected to the MCU module, controlled by MCU defined by the user.

##### RESET Push Button

The Reset Push Button is shown in [**Figure 2**](#interfaces) and is connected to the MCU module. When pushed, it resets the MCU.

#### Pin Definition

The RAK19014 Battery Power Slot Module has a 40-pin WisConnector that is compatible with the WisBlock Power Slot. The pin order of the connector and the pinout definition is shown in **Figure 5**.

::: tip üìù NOTE
VBAT, 3V3, RESET, LED1, LED2, and GND are connected to the WisBlock IO connector.
