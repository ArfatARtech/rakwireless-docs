## Product Configuration

### Hardware Setup

RAK14008 is a gesture sensor module based on PAJ7620U2. It is designed for gesture recognition applications with an I2C digital interface. It can recognize nine (9) human hand gesticulations such as moving up, down, left, right, forward, backward, circle-clockwise, circle-counter clockwise, and waving. It also offers built-in proximity detection in sensing approaching or departing objects from the sensor.

For more information about RAK14008, refer to the [Datasheet](../Datasheet/).

RAK14008 module can be connected to the IO slot of [WisBlock Base](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/#wisblock-base) to communicate with the WisBlock Core, as shown in **Figure 1**. Also, always secure the connection of the WisBlock module by using compatible screws.

#### Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules

##### Assembling

The RAK14008 module can be mounted on the IO slot of the WisBlock Base board, as shown in **Figure 2**. Also, always secure the connection of the WisBlock module by using compatible screws.

  width="60%"
  caption="RAK14008 mounting connection to WisBlock Base module"
/>

##### Disassembling

The procedure in disassembling any type of WisBlock module is the same. 

1. First, remove the screws.

  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak14008/quickstart/removing_screw.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Removing screws from the WisBlock module"
/>

2. Once the screws are removed, check the silkscreen of the module to find the correct location where force can be applied.

  width="70%"
  caption="Detaching silkscreen on the WisBlock module"

3. Apply force to the module at the position of the connector, as shown in **Figure 5**, to detach the module from the baseboard.

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you will connect other modules to the remaining WisBlock Base slots, check on the [WisBlock Pin Mapper](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Pin-Mapper/) tool for possible conflicts. 
:::

After all this setup, you can now connect the battery (optional) and USB cable to start programming your WisBlock Core.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
- Batteries can cause harm if not handled properly.
- Only 3.7-4.2&nbsp;V Rechargeable LiPo batteries are supported. It is highly recommended not to use other types of batteries with the system unless you know what you are doing.
- If a non-rechargeable battery is used, it has to be unplugged first before connecting the USB cable to the USB port of the board to configure the device. Not doing so might damage the battery or cause a fire.
- Only 5&nbsp;V solar panels are supported. Do not use 12&nbsp;V solar panels. It will destroy the charging unit and eventually other electronic parts.
- Make sure the battery wires match the polarity on the WisBlock Base board. Not all batteries have the same wiring.

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you experience any error in compiling the example sketch, check the updated code for your WisBlock Core Module that can be found on the [RAK14008 WisBlock Example Code Repository](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/tree/master/examples/common/sensors/RAK14008_Gesture_PAJ7620) and this sample code in Github will work on all WisBlock Core.
:::

4. Once the example code is open, install the [PAJ7620](https://github.com/acrandal/RevEng_PAJ7620) library by clicking the yellow highlighted link, as shown in **Figure 9** and **Figure 10**.

5. After the successful installation of the library, you can now select the right serial port and upload the code, as shown in **Figure 11** and **Figure 12**.

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you're using the RAK11200 as your WisBlock Core, the RAK11200 requires the **Boot0** pin to be configured properly first before uploading. If not done properly, uploading the source code to RAK11200 will fail. Check the full details on the [RAK11200 Quick Start Guide](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK11200/Quickstart/#uploading-to-wisblock).

6. When you successfully uploaded the example sketch, open the Serial Monitor of the Arduino IDE, set the baud rate correctly, and once you have made a gesture or movement in front of the RAK14008 sensor, you'll be able to see the sensor's output as shown below in **Figure 13**. Therefore, your RAK14008 is properly communicating to the WisBlock core.
