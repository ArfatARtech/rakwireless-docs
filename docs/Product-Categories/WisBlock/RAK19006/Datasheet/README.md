# RAK19006 WisBlock Wireless Charge Module Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

The RAK19006 WisBlock wireless charge module was designed to be a part of battery charger. The RAK19006 is highly efficient, Qi-compliant, single-chip wireless power receiver and charger. It integrates the receiver and linear charger and supports up-to 5&nbsp;W applications. This board can be connected with the WisBlock Base board like RAK5005-O through IO slot or through two pogo pins. The chip supports wireless charge and directly battery charging. 

### Features

- WPC 1.2.4 compliant wireless power receiver
- JEITA compatible charge
- Ultra-low leakage current without transmitter
- Wireless and wired charge
- OVP, OCP, and OTP protection
- Supports up-to 5&nbsp;W applications
- Module size: 15 X 25&nbsp;mm

## Specifications

### Overview
