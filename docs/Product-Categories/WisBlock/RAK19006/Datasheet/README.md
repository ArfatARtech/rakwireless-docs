# RAK19006 WisBlock Wireless Charge Module Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

The RAK19006 WisBlock Wireless Charge Module is designed to be a part of the battery charger. It is highly efficient, Qi-compliant, and has a single-chip wireless power receiver and charger. It integrates the receiver and linear charger and supports up to 5&nbsp;W applications.

This board can be connected with the WisBlock Base board like RAK5005-O through the IO slot or two pogo pins. The chip supports wireless charge and direct battery charging. 

### Features

- WPC 1.2.4 compliant wireless power receiver
- JEITA compatible charge
- Ultra-low leakage current without transmitter
- Wireless and wired charge
- OVP, OCP, and OTP protection
- Supports up to 5&nbsp;W applications
- Module size: 15 X 25&nbsp;mm

## Specifications

### Overview

#### Mounting

The RAK19006 module can be mounted on the IO slot of the WisBlock Base board. **Figure 1** shows the mounting mechanism of the RAK19006 on a WisBlock Base module, such as the RAK5005-O.

### Hardware

The hardware specification discusses the pinouts, and its corresponding functions and diagrams of the module. It also covers the electrical and mechanical characteristics that include the tabular data of the functionalities and standard values of the RAK19006 WisBlock Module.

#### Pin Definition

The RAK19006 module has a 40-pin WisConnector that is compatible to the WisBlock Base IO Slot. The pin order of the connector and the pinout definition is shown in **Figure 2**.

::: tip üìù NOTE
- Only **GND** and **nEN** are connected to this module.

- **nEN** is the wireless charge chip enable pin, active low. A resistor (R4) is connected to nEN to GND, so by default, this chip is enable. If you want to disable it, pull the nEN to high.
