# WisBlock Home and Office Security Kit Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

The **WisBlock Home and Office Security Kit** is a comprehensive and customizable IoT kit that is designed to provide security for homes and offices. This kit includes a range of sensors and modules that focus on detecting intrusion and access control. The intrusion detection sensors include PIR, radar, and ultrasonic sensors that provide reliable and accurate detection of movement and intrusion. The access control modules include fingerprint, NFC, and barcode sensors that provide secure and convenient access to your home or office.

Depending on the use case, this kit supports different connectivity options, including LoRaWAN, BLE, LTE-M, and NB-IoT,enabling long-range and short-range communication. With this kit, you can easily monitor your home or office remotely, receive real-time alerts, and take appropriate action in the event of an intrusion or unauthorized access attempt.
