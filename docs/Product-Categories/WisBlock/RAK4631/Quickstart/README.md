More information can be found on the [official documentation of the specific WisBlock Base](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/#wisblock-base) you used in your project.

For RAK5005-O WisBlock Base with RAK4631 WisBlock Core, the accessible GPIO pins are defined as follows in the Arduino IDE and Platform IO:

- `WB_IO1` for IO1 pin
- `WB_IO2` for IO2 pin (Also used to control the 3.3V supply of some WisBlock Modules to achieve low-power IoT devices.)
- `WB_A0` for AIN

There are usable LEDs as well that can be controlled by the RAK4631 on the WisBlock Base board:

- `WB_LED1` for LED1   
- `WB_LED2` for LED2

UART1 and I2C_1 are also exposed on the header of the WisBlock Base board.

- RAK4631 has a native USB peripheral onboard (Serial) which is used for programming and Serial debugging and two usable hardware **UART1** and **UART2** (Serial 1 and Serial 2). **UART1** is accessible to WisBlock Slot A, WisBlock IO slot, and the exposed header pins. **UART2** is accessible only on the WisBlock IO slot.
- The **I2C_1** header pins are as well shared to the WisBlock Base Slots A to D. The second **I2C_2** is available only on the WisBlock IO slot.


#### RAK4631 to WisBlock Modules

RAK4631 WisBlock Core is designed to be interfaced to other WisBlock Modules like sensors, displays, and other interfaces. You need to connect these modules to the compatible slots on the WisBlock Base.

Each WisBlock Modules that will be used with RAK4631 WisBlock Core have a dedicated quick start guide you can follow on how to connect to the WisBlock Base.

Examples listed are the quick start guide of the following WisBlock Modules:

## Miscellaneous

### How to Check if You Have the Updated RAK4631 Bootloader

You need to connect the RAK4631 to PC via USB cable and double click reset button on the WisBlock Base.

There will be a new drive named `RAK4631` that will be shown on your folder explorer. Inside this drive, there will a text file named `INFO_UF2.TXT`, as shown in Figure 15.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak4631/quickstart/new_drive.png"
  width="60%"
  caption="RAK4631 drive content"
/>

If you open `INFO_UF2.TXT`, you'll see `Date: Mar 31 2021`, as shown in Figure 16.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak4631/quickstart/info_uf2txt.png"
  width="40%"
  caption="INFO_UF2.TXT content"
/>

If you have a different drive name or older date, it means you do not have the updated RAK4631 Bootloader and you need to update it. 


### Updating the Bootloader

RAK4631 WisBlock Core is programmed with a USB bootloader so that you can upload application firmware to it without using any external tools like Jlink and other programmers/debuggers. However, there are situations that you need to update the bootloader when there is an updated version that supports new features, improvements, and bug fixes.

There are various ways to update the bootloader like via USB, Bluetooth, and Jlink. The procedure for these methods is explained in this guide. 

#### Bootloader update via USB

In this method, you need two things:

1. Adafruit-nrfutil utility program.
2. RAK4631 Bootloader FW.

##### For Windows

Download the [adafruit-nrfutil.exe](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_nrfutil/releases/download/%24(APPVEYOR_REPO_TAG_NAME)/adafruit-nrfutil.exe) and the latest [RAK4631 bootloader firmware](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/blob/0093b9b5d7ec3c32c3fe3550b797fe364582b083/bootloader/RAK4630/new/RAK4630_bootloader-0.4.1.zip).

:::tip üìù NOTE
Detailed information about the RAK4631 Bootloader can be found on the [bootloader repository](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/tree/0093b9b5d7ec3c32c3fe3550b797fe364582b083/bootloader/RAK4630). 
:::

Once you downloaded these files, you need to put them on a same directory/folder in your computer.

For simplicity, this guide will assume the files are in C: drive.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak4631/quickstart/c_location.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Adafruit-nrfutil and RAK4631 Bootloader file in C: drive"
/>

When the files are ready, you need to open Windows Command Prompt application. Then you need to change the location to C:\.

`cd C:\`

After that, you can now execute the update using this command.

`adafruit-nrfutil.exe --verbose dfu serial --package RAK4630_bootloader-0.4.1.zip --port COM8 -b 115200 --singlebank --touch 1200`

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak4631/quickstart/success_upload.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="RAK4631 Bootloader Updated Successfully"
/>

You need to determine the right COM port number of your device. COM8 on the command above is only for illustration. You will get an error if you are not connected to the right COM port number.

##### For Linux

You can get and install adafruit-nrfutil via pip3.

`sudo pip3 install adafruit-nrfutil`

or

`pip3 install --user adafruit-nrfutil`

Then download the latest [RAK4631 bootloader firmware](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/blob/0093b9b5d7ec3c32c3fe3550b797fe364582b083/bootloader/RAK4630/new/RAK4630_bootloader-0.4.1.zip).

You also need to determine the port name of the RAK4631 using the command:

`ls /dev/tty*`

After determining the port name, go to the directory where the bootloader FW file `RAK4630_bootloader-0.4.1.zip` is located.

Then execute the following command:

`adafruit-nrfutil --verbose dfu serial --package RAK4630_bootloader-0.4.1.zip -p /dev/ttyACM0 -b 115200 --singlebank --touch 1200`


##### For macOS

The same with Windows and Linux procedures, download the latest [RAK4631 bootloader firmware](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/blob/0093b9b5d7ec3c32c3fe3550b797fe364582b083/bootloader/RAK4630/new/RAK4630_bootloader-0.4.1.zip).

There are two ways to update the RAK4631 bootloader in macOS.

- If you have Python installed, you can follow the same steps for Linux.

- Another way is by creating a macOS executable. To do this method, download [adafruit-nrfutil-macos](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_nrfutil/releases/download/%24(APPVEYOR_REPO_TAG_NAME)/adafruit-nrfutil-macos) and make it executable.

Usually, the `adafruit-nrfutil-macos` file will go to the downloads folder. 

The next step after downloading the file is to open the terminal and go to the downloads directory or the location where you put the downloaded file.

`cd /Users/username/Downloads`

And then execute this command:

`chmod +x adafruit-nrfutil-macos`

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak4631/quickstart/macos_executable.png"
  width="50%"
  caption="Executable adafruit-nrfutil-macos"
/>

You also need to determine the port name of the RAK4631 using the command:

`ls /dev/cu.*`.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak4631/quickstart/macos_checkport.png"
  width="50%"
  caption="Checking the RAK4631 USB port connection"
/>

After all these steps, you can now upload the latest RAK4631 Bootloader Firmware by executing this command:

`adafruit-nrfutil-macos --verbose dfu serial --package RAK4630_bootloader-0.4.1.zip -p /dev/cu.usbmodem411 -b 115200 --singlebank --touch 1200`

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak4631/quickstart/macos_boot_update.png"
  width="60%"
  caption="Updated RAK4631 Bootloader"
/>

Your RAK4631 will now have the updated Bootloader Firmware.
