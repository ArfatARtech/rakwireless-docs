## Product Configuration

### Hardware Setup

#### RAK4631 to WisBlock Base

The RAK4631 will not work without a WisBlock Base board. The WisBlock Base provides a USB connection for programming the RAK4632. It also provides a power source and various interfaces to RAK4631 so that it can be connected to other WisBlock modules via different module slots. RAK4631 can be connected to RAK5005-O, as shown in Figure 1.

More information can be found on the [official documentation of the specific WisBlock Base](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/#wisblock-base) you used in your project.

For RAK5005-O WisBlock Base with RAK4631 WisBlock Core, the accessible GPIO pins are defined as follows in the Arduino IDE and Platform IO:

- `WB_IO1` for IO1 pin
- `WB_IO2` for IO2 pin (Also used to control the 3.3V supply of some WisBlock Modules to achieve low-power IoT devices.)
- `WB_A0` for AIN

There are usable LEDs as well that can be controlled by the RAK4631 on the WisBlock Base board:

- `WB_LED1` for LED1   
- `WB_LED2` for LED2

UART1 and I2C_1 are also exposed on the header of the WisBlock Base board.

- RAK4631 has a native USB peripheral onboard (Serial) which is used for programming and Serial debugging and two usable hardware **UART1** and **UART2** (Serial 1 and Serial 2). **UART1** is accessible to WisBlock Slot A, WisBlock IO slot, and the exposed header pins. **UART2** is accessible only on the WisBlock IO slot.
- The **I2C_1** header pins are as well shared to the WisBlock Base Slots A to D. The second **I2C_2** is available only on the WisBlock IO slot.


#### RAK4631 to WisBlock Modules

RAK4631 WisBlock Core is designed to be interfaced to other WisBlock Modules like sensors, displays, and other interfaces. You need to connect these modules to the compatible slots on the WisBlock Base.

Each WisBlock Modules that will be used with RAK4631 WisBlock Core have a dedicated quick start guide you can follow on how to connect to the WisBlock Base.

Examples listed are the quick start guide of the following WisBlock Modules:

- [RAK1901 Quick Start Guide](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK1901/Quickstart/)
