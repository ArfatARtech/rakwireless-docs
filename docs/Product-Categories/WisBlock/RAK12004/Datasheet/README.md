### Hardware

The hardware specification is categorized into five parts. It shows the chipset of the module and discusses the pinouts and its corresponding functions and diagrams. It also covers the electrical and mechanical characteristics that include the tabular data of the functionalities and standard values of the RAK12004 WisBlock MQ2 Gas Sensor Module.


####  Chipset

| Vendor | Part number |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Winsen | MQ-2        |

#### Pin Definition

The RAK12004 WisBlock MQ2 Gas Sensor Module comprises a standard 40-pin WisConnector. The WisConnector allows the RAK12004 module to mounted to a WisBlock Base Board, such as RAK5005-O. The pin order of the connector and the pinout definition is shown in Figure 2.

#### Schematic Diagram

##### Power Supply Circuit

Figure 5 shows RAK12004 step-up power supply circuit. 

* **VBAT** Battery voltage (max voltage is 4.2&nbsp;V) 
* **EN** Power enable pin (active high). This pin is connected to **IO6** of WisBlock Core.

##### Gas Detector Circuit

Figure 6 shows the gas detector circuit.

* **U2** Gas sensor

The heater voltage requires a 5&nbsp;V supply which is provided by the 5&nbsp;V step-up converter. This is needed to achieve the standard working temperature of the sensor. The pins 1 and 3 voltage (5&nbsp;V) supply the detect voltage to load resistance R12. The **AOUT** pin is the voltage of load resistance R12 which represents the reading of the U2 sensor.

* **U3** 12-Bit Analog-to-Digital converter with alert function. The U3 power supply is 5&nbsp;V.

##### Voltage Level Shifter Circuit

The 40-pin WisConnector voltage has a voltage level of 3.3&nbsp;V while U2 and U3 have 5&nbsp;V. To interface the different voltage level between 40-pin Wisconnector and gas sensor, the RAK12004 has a built-in voltage level shifter circuit.
