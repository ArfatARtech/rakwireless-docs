## Product Configuration

### Hardware Setup

RAK18080 is a professional audio processing module, part of the **WisBlock Audio Series**.

For more information about RAK18080, refer to the [Datasheet](../Datasheet/).

RAK18080 module can be connected to the IO slot of the WisBlock Base to communicate with the WisBlock Core. Always secure the connection of the WisBlock module by using compatible screws.

#### Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules

##### Assembling

As shown in **Figure 2**, the location for the IO slot is properly marked by silkscreen. Follow carefully the procedure defined in [WisBlock Base board assembly/disassembly instructions](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK5005-O-Baseboard-Installation-Guide/) to attach a WisBlock module. Once attached, carefully fix the module with one or more pieces of M1.2 x 3&nbsp;mm screws depending on the module.

  width="70%"
  caption="RAK18080 connection to WisBlock Base"

  width="70%"
  caption="LoRa and BLE antennas of RAK4631"
/>

##### Disassembling

The procedure in disassembling any type of WisBlock module is the same.

1. First, remove the screws.

  width="70%"
  caption="Removing screws from the WisBlock module"
/>

2. Once the screws are removed, check the silkscreen of the module to find the correct location where force can be applied.

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you will connect other modules to the remaining WisBlock Base slots, check on the [WisBlock Pin Mapper](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Pin-Mapper/) tool for possible conflicts. RAK18080 uses I2C communication lines, and it can cause possible conflict, especially on other WisBlock Modules connected to Slot A to D of the WisBlock Base.
:::

After all this setup, you can now connect the battery (optional) and USB cable to start programming your WisBlock Core.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
- Batteries can cause harm if not handled properly.
- Only 3.7-4.2&nbsp;V Rechargeable LiPo batteries are supported. It is highly recommended not to use other types of batteries with the system unless you know what you are doing.
- If a non-rechargeable battery is used, it has to be unplugged first before connecting the USB cable to the USB port of the board to configure the device. Not doing so might damage the battery or cause a fire.
- Only 5&nbsp;V solar panels are supported. Do not use 12&nbsp;V solar panels. It will destroy the charging unit and eventually other electronic parts.
- Make sure the battery wires match the polarity on the WisBlock Base board. Not all batteries have the same wiring.

### Software Configuration and Example

RAK18080 design is based on DBM10L by Synaptics. The DBM10L is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) SoC based on a digital processor (DSP) optimized for voice and sensor processing. DBM10L can enable AI/ML, voice, and sensor applications, including Voice Trigger (VT), Voice Authentication (VA), Voice Command (VC), Noise Reduction (NR), Acoustic Echo Cancellation (AEC), and Sound Event Detection (SED). When used with **WisBlock Audio Stack**, RAK18080 can do VT and provide I2S data to the speaker. For this example, you will be using the **RAK4631** as your WisBlock Core.

#### Initial Test of the RAK18080 WisBlock Module

For this example, you need to use the **RAK18080 (DSP chip)**, **RAK18003 (Audio Interposer)**, **RAK18030 (PDM Microphone)** and **RAK18061 (Mono Amplifier)** modules. This example code is for a voice processing application. Also, you will need the following:
  - Li-Ion/LiPo battery
  - Speaker

1.  The **RAK18061** module is powered via **SB2 (battery)** by default. If you wish to use other DC power source, refer to the figures below.

  width="60%"
  caption="Power Select Diagram for RAK18061 with SB2 as default"
/>

   **3V3**

   If you want to use 3V3, desolder SB2 and solder SB1.

  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak18080/quickstart/Arduino-Example-14.png"
  width="60%"
  caption="Solder portion for SB1"
/>

   **VBUS**

   If you want to use VBUS, desolder SB2 and solder SB3.

   **EX_POWER**

   If you want to use EX_POWER, desolder SB2 and solder SB4.

3. Assemble the modules, as shown in the figure below. In this configuration, here's how the boards are stacked up:
   - RAK18061 (top)
   - RAK18080
   - RAK18003 + RAK18030
   - WisBlock Base board (bottom)
