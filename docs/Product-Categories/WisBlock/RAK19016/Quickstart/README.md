# RAK19016 Quick Start Guide

## Prerequisite

### What Do You Need?

Before going through each and every step on using the RAK19016 WisBlock 5-24V Power Slot Module, make sure to prepare the necessary items listed below:

#### Hardware

- [RAK19016 WisBlock 5-24V Power Slot Module](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak19016-5-24v-power-slot-module?utm_source=RAK19016&utm_medium=Document&utm_campaign=BuyFromStore)
- Your choice of [WisBlock Base board with Power Slot](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-base/)
- Your choice of [WisBlock Core](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-core)
- [Li-Ion/LiPo battery (optional)](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-accessory/products/battery-connector-cable?utm_source=BatteryConnector&utm_medium=Document&utm_campaign=BuyFromStore)
- [RAK5804 WisBlock Interface Module](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak5804-io-extension-board?utm_source=RAK5804&utm_medium=Document&utm_campaign=BuyFromStore) (Reprogramming of the WisBlock Core via USB of RAK5804)

#### Software

##### Arduino

- Download and install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
- To add the RAKwireless WisBlock Core boards to your Arduino Boards Manager, install the [RAKwireless Arduino BSP](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index).

## Product Configuration

### Hardware Setup

RAK19016 should be attached to the power slot connector of WisBlock Base board with power slot. The 5&nbsp;V to 24&nbsp;V DC input voltage must be connected to the 3-pin screw terminal connector. The LiPo/Li-Ion battery can be connected to the standard battery connector.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

RAK19016 **only** supports WisBlock Base boards with power slot. It is not compatible with all WisBlock Base boards.

:::

For more information about RAK19016, refer to the [Datasheet](../Datasheet/).

::: tip üìù NOTE
The voltage of the battery must not exceed 4.3&nbsp;V.

#### RAK19016 Supplemented by RAK5804 to Support WisBlock Core Reprogramming

Since there is no USB connector on RAK19016, the only way to upload the code is by using RAK5804.

#### Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules

##### Assembling Procedure

The RAK19016 module can be mounted on the power slot of the WisBlock Base board, as shown in **Figure 3**. Also, always secure the connection of the WisBlock module by using compatible screws.

##### Disassembling Procedure

The procedure in disassembling any type of WisBlock module is the same.

1. First, remove the screws.

2. Once the screws are removed, check the silkscreen of the module to find the correct location where force can be applied.

3. Apply force to the module at the position of the connector, as shown in **Figure 6**, to detach the module from the baseboard.

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you will connect other modules to the remaining WisBlock Base slots, check on the [WisBlock Pin Mapper](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Pin-Mapper/) tool for possible conflicts.

#### Battery Connector

##### Rechargeable Battery

RAK19016 supports a rechargeable Li-Ion/LiPo battery via the dedicated connector. The battery and external 5-24&nbsp;V DC input can simultaneously be connected to provide power to all WisBlock modules. The 5-24&nbsp;V<sub>DC</sub> goes to a buck converter with 4.4&nbsp;V<sub>DC</sub> output which is higher than the max 4.2 of LiPo battery. 5-24<sub>DC</sub>V DC is the primary power source and also charges the LiPo battery at the same time.

The matching connector for the rechargeable battery wires is a [JST PHR-2 2&nbsp;mm pitch female](https://www.jst-mfg.com/product/detail_e.php?series=199). A cable assembly for the rechargeable battery connector is also available for purchase in [RAK store](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/battery-connector-cable).

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

- Battery can cause harm if not handled properly.
- Only 3.7-4.2&nbsp;V rechargeable LiPo batteries are supported. It is highly recommended not to use other types of batteries with the system unless you know what you are doing.
- Make sure the battery wires, both rechargeable and non-rechargeable, match the polarity on the RAK19016 board. Not all batteries have the same wiring.

### Software Setup

There is no software required to use RAK19016. But to control the two user LEDs and monitor the battery voltage, it must be attached to a WisBlock Base and WisBlock Core.

#### WisBlock Examples Repository

To quickly build your IoT device with less hassle, example codes for WisBlock Core are provided. You can access the codes on the [WisBlock Example code repository](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/tree/master/examples). The example codes on folder `common` are compatible with RAK4631, RAK11200, and RAK11310 WisBlock Cores.
The two user LEDs of RAK19016 can be accessed using macrodefinitions `LED_GREEN` / `PIN_LED1` for the green LED and `LED_BLUE` / `PIN_LED2` for the blue LED. For the battery voltage reading, `WB_A0` is used.
