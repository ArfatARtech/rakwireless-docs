# RAK3372 AT Command Manual

## Overview

To integrate LoRa technology into your projects, the RAK3372 is implemented with an easy-to-use Serial Port communication interface where you can send AT commands. Through these AT commands, you can set the parameters needed for LoRa P2P and LoRaWAN communication.

## RUI3 AT Command List

The RAK3372 default firmware is based on [RUI3 (RAKwireless Unified Interface V3)](/RUI3/#overview). You can access the AT command via UART2 by default (and also possible via UART1).

The complete list of commands can be found in [RUI3 AT Commands Documentation.](/RUI3/Serial-Operating-Modes/AT-Command-Manual/#content)


:::tip üìù NOTE:
UART1 and UART2 modes of operation and its configuration can be found on [RUI3 Serial Operating Modes](/RUI3/Serial-Operating-Modes/#rak-unified-interface-v3-rui3-serial-operating-modes). Both UARTs can be configured in [Binary Mode](https://docs.rakwireless.com/RUI3/Serial-Operating-Modes/Binary-Command-Manual/) as well.
