#### Schematic Diagram

##### Digital Microphone

The **Pin 2** of the SPH0655LM4H-1 is used to control the MIC as a left or right channel.

- The MIC is the left channel when **Pin 2** is `HIGH`.
- The MIC is the right channel when **Pin 2** is `LOW`.

By default, the RAK18032 is the right channel. But, you can remove the 10K&nbsp;Ohms resistor on **R9** and connect it to **R8** to change the MIC to the left channel as its default. You may also use **MIC_CTR_IO1** to select the MIC as the right or left channel.
