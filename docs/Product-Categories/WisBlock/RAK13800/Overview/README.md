## Product Description

RAK13800 is an Ethernet module based on the W5100S-L chip from WIZnet. The module has an embedded Internet Controller Chip that integrates a Hardwired TCP/IP stack with 10/100 Ethernet MAC and PHY. It is truly a one-chip solution for stable internet connectivity.

The RAK13800 TCP/IP stack supports TCP, UDP, IPv4, ICMP, ARP, IGMP, and PPPoE ‚Äì and it has been proven through various applications over the last decade.

The user can develop an Ethernet application easily by using the simple SOCKETs program instead of handling a complex Ethernet controller. W5100S-L provides four independent SOCKETs to be used simultaneously and 16&nbsp;KB internal memory for RX/TX data communication buffer.
