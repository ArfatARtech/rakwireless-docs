# RAK13800 WisBlock Ethernet Module Datasheet

## Description

RAK13800 is an Ethernet module based on the W5100S-L chip from WIZnet. The module has an embedded Internet Controller Chip that integrates a Hardwired TCP/IP stack with 10/100 Ethernet MAC and PHY. It is truly a one-chip solution for stable internet connectivity.

The RAK13800 TCP/IP stack supports TCP, UDP, IPv4, ICMP, ARP, IGMP, and PPPoE ‚Äì and it has been proven through various applications over the last decade.

The user can develop an Ethernet application easily by using the simple SOCKETs program instead of handling a complex Ethernet controller. W5100S-L provides four independent SOCKETs to be used simultaneously and 16KB internal memory for RX/TX data communication buffer.

::: tip üìù NOTE
RAK13800 can be POE enabled by mounting its daughter power board [WisBlock RAK19018 POE Module](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK19018/Overview).

### Hardware

The hardware specification is categorized into four parts. It shows the pinouts and their corresponding functions. It also covers the electrical and mechanical parameters that include the tabular data of its characteristics. This section also shows the schematic diagram of RAK13800.

####  Chipset

| Vendor | Part number |
| ------ | ----------- |
| WIZnet | W5100S-L    |

#### Pin Definition

The RAK13800 WisBlock Ethernet module comprises a standard 40-pin IO Connector. The IO connector allows the RAK13800 module to be mounted to a WisBlock Base Board, such as RAK5005-O. The pin order of the connector and the pinout definition is shown in **Figure 4**.

:::tip üìù NOTES:
- SPI-related pins, INTn, CSn, RSTnÔºå3V3_S, and GND are connected to IO Connector.
- +5&nbsp;V is connected to the WisBlock IO connector to power the WisBlock Base Board with RAK19018 POE.
