# RAK15001 Quick Start Guide



## Prerequisite

### What Do You Need?

Before going through each and every step on using the RAK15001 WisBlock module, make sure to prepare the necessary items listed below:

#### Hardware

- [RAK15001 WisBlock Flash module](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-storage/products/wisblock-flash-module-rak15001)
- Your choice of [WisBlock Base](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-base) 
- Your choice of [WisBlock Core](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-core)
- USB Cable
- [Li-Ion/LiPo battery (optional)](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-accessory/products/battery-connector-cable)
- [Solar charger (optional)](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-accessory/products/solar-panel-connector-cable)

#### Software

- Download and install [ArduinoIDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
- To add the RAKwireless Core boards on your Arduino Boards Manager, install the [RAKwireless Arduino BSP](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index).

## Product Configuration

### Hardware Setup

WisBlock can integrate this module which makes it easy for you to save big data on such applications that you need to access frequently, like conversion tables, lookup tables or images, and even sound files. But compared to the EEPROM module, the RAK15001 Flash Memory module has fewer write/erase cycles, so it is not an ideal storage for constantly changing data like for sensor readings.

For more information about RAK15001, please refer to the [Datasheet](../Datasheet/).

RAK15001 module can be connected to any slot of WisBlock Base to communicate with the WisBlock Core. It will work on **SLOT A, B, C, or D**. Also, always secure the connection of the WisBlock module by using compatible screws.

#### Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules

##### Assembling

As shown in **Figure 2**, the location for Slot A, B, C, and D are properly marked by silkscreen. Follow carefully the procedure defined in [RAK5005-O module assembly/disassembly instructions](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK5005-O-Baseboard-Installation-Guide/) to attach a WisBlock module. Once attached, carefully fix the module with one or more pieces of M1.2 x 3&nbsp;mm screws depending on the module.

  caption="Sensor connection to WisBlock Base"
/>

##### Disassembling

The procedure in disassembling any type of WisBlock modules is the same. 

1. First, remove the screws.

  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak15001/quickstart/removing-screws.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Removing screws from the WisBlock module"
/>

2. Once the screws are removed, check the silkscreen of the module to find the correct location where force can be applied.

3. Apply force to the module at the position of the connector, as shown in **Figure 5**, to detach the module from the baseboard.

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you will connect other modules to the remaining WisBlock Base slots, check on the [WisBlock Pin Mapper](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Pin-Mapper/) tool for possible conflicts. RAK15001 uses SPI communication lines, and it can cause possible conflict especially on some IO modules.
:::

After all this setup, you can now connect the battery (optional) and USB cable to start programming your WisBlock Core.

### Software Configuration and Example

The RAK15001 is a NOR flash module with a 16&nbsp;MBit (2&nbsp;MByte) nonvolatile memory. It uses GD25Q16CNIG (16&nbsp;Mbit) from GigaDevice with a standard SPI interface.

These are the quick links that go directly to the software guide for the specific WisBlock Core module you use:

#### RAK15001 in RAK4631 WisBlock Core Guide

If you already installed the [RAKwireless Arduino BSP](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index), the WisBlock Core and example code should now be available on the Arduino IDE.

1. First, you need to select the RAK4631 WisBlock Core.
