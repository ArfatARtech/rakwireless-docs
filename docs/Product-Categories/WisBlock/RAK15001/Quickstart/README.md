# RAK15001 Quick Start Guide

<!--
## Introduction

This guide introduces the WisBlock RAK15001 WisBlock Flash module and how to program with it.
-->

## Prerequisite

### What Do You Need?

Before going through each and every step on using RAK15001 WisBlock module, make sure to prepare the necessary items listed below:

#### Hardware

- [RAK15001 WisBlock Flash module](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-storage/products/wisblock-flash-module-rak15001)
- Your choice of [WisBlock Base](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-base) 
- Your choice of [WisBlock Core](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-core)
- USB Cable
- [Li-Ion/LiPo battery (optional)](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK5005-O/Datasheet/#battery-connector)
- [Solar charger (optional)](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK5005-O/Datasheet/#solar-panel-connector)

#### Software

- Download and install [ArduinoIDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
- To add the RAKwireless Core boards on your Arduino Boards Manager, install the [RAKwireless Arduino BSP](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index).

## Product Configuration

### Hardware Setup

WisBlock can integrate this module which makes it easy for you to save big data on such applications that you need to access frequently, like conversion tables, lookup tables or images, and even sound files. But compared to the EEPROM module, the RAK15001 Flash Memory module has a fewer write/erase cycles, so it is not an ideal storage for constantly changing data like for sensor readings.

For more information about RAK15001, please refer to the [Datasheet](../Datasheet/).

RAK15001 module can be connected to any slot of WisBlock Base to communicate with the WisBlock Core. It will work on **SLOT A, B, C, or D**. Also, always secure the connection of the WisBlock module by using the compatible screws.

#### Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules

##### Assembling

As shown in **Figure 2**, the location for Slot A, B, C, and D are properly marked by silkscreen. Follow carefully the procedure defined in [RAK5005-O module assembly/disassembly instructions](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK5005-O-Baseboard-Installation-Guide/) to attach a WisBlock module. Once attached, carefully fix the module with one or more pieces of M1.2 x 3&nbsp;mm screws depending on the module.

##### Disassembling

The procedure in disassembling any type of WisBlock modules is the same. 

1. First, remove the screws.

2. Once the screws are removed, check the silkscreen of the module to find the correct location where force can be applied.

3. Apply force to the module at the position of the connector, as shown in **Figure 5**, to detach the module from the baseboard.

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you will connect other modules to the remaining WisBlock Base slots, check on the [WisBlock Pin Mapper](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Pin-Mapper/) tool for possible conflicts. RAK15001 uses SPI communication lines, and it can cause possible conflict especially on some IO modules.
:::

After all this setup, you can now connect the battery (optional) and USB cable to start programming your WisBlock Core.

### Software Configuration and Example

The RAK15001 is a NOR flash module with a 16&nbsp;MBit (2&nbsp;MByte) nonvolatile memory. It uses GD25Q16CNIG (16&nbsp;Mbit) from GigaDevice with standard SPI interface.

#### Initial Test of the RAK15001 WisBlock Module

If you already installed the [RAKwireless Arduino BSP](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index), the WisBlock Core and example code should now be available on the Arduino IDE.

1. You need to select first the WisBlock Core you have, as shown in **Figure 6** and **Figure 7**.

  width="100%"

/>

2. The [Basic Sample Code for RAK15001](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/tree/master/examples/common/sensors/RAK15001_Flash_GD25Q16C) in Github will work on all WisBlock Core. You can open the the example codes depending on your WisBlock Core, as shown in **Figure 8** and **Figure 9**.

  width="100%"
  caption="Opening RAK15001 example code for RAK11200 WisBlock Core"
/>

3. Once the example code is open, install the [Adafruit_SPIFlash](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SPIFlash) library by clicking the link highlighted in yellow, as shown in **Figure 10** and **Figure 11**.

4. After successful installation of the library, you can now select the right serial port and upload the code, as shown in **Figure 12** and **Figure 13**.

5. When you successfully uploaded the example sketch, open the Serial Monitor of the Arduino IDE to see if it read the content, wrote new data, and erased the data from the Flash module. If you see the logs, as shown in **Figure 14**, then your RAK15001 is properly communicating to the WisBlock core.
