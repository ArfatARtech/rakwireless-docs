### Hardware

The hardware specification is categorized into five (5) parts. It shows the chipset of the module and discusses the pinouts and their corresponding functions and diagrams. It also covers the acoustic, electrical, and mechanical parameters that include the tabular data of the functionalities and standard values of the RAK18061 Audio Mono Amplifier Module.


#### Chipset

| Vendor | Part number |
| ------ | ----------- |
| TI     | TAS2560     |

#### Pin Definition

##### IO Slot Connector

The RAK18061 WisBlock module comprises a standard IO slot connector. The 40-pin WisBlock IO Slot Connector allows the RAK18061 module to be mounted to a WisBlock baseboard, such as the RAK5005-O. The pin order of the connector and the pinout definition is shown in **Figure 4**.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
- **3V3_S** and **GND** are the power supply pins from the WisBlock Base. **3V3_S**, **VBAT**, and **VBUS** can be selected by the solder bridge as the amplifier power. **3V3_S** is always needed for digital power input.
- **AMP_INT** is a GPIO pin (IO1) from WisBlock Core. Normally, this pin is **HIGH**. It will be **LOW** if there is an error within the amplifier.
- **Core_I2S_DO**, **Core_I2S_DI**, **Core_I2S_WS**, and **Core_I2S_BCLK** are I2S signals.
- **Device_I2C_SDA** and **Device_I2C_SCL** are I2C signals, which control the TAS2560.

##### Stack Connector

The RAK18061 WisBlock module comprises a board-to-board (BTB) connector. The BTB connector allows the RAK18061 module to be stacked with other WisBlock Audio modules, such as the RAK18080 (DSP board) and the RAK18003 (Audio Interposer board). The pin order of the connector and the pinout definition is shown in **Figure 5**.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
- **3V3**, **VBAT**, **VBUS**, and **GND** are power supply pins from the Interposer board. **3V3**, **VBAT**, and **VBUS** can be selected by the solder bridge as the amplifier power. **3V3** is always needed for digital power input.
- **AMP_CTR_IO1** is the GPIO from the interposer board. Normally, this pin is **HIGH**. This pin will be **LOW** if there is an error within the amplifier and is shared between both amplifiers.
- **AMP_I2S_DO**, **AMP_I2S_DI**, **AMP_I2S_WS**, and **AMP_I2S_BCLK** are I2S signals.
- **Device_I2C_SDA** and **Device_I2C_SCL** are I2C signals which control the TAS2560.
**AMP_Check** is the GPIO from the interposer board. It is used to check whether an Amplifier board is connected. This pin is **LOW** when there is no Amplifier board and will be **HIGH** when an Amplifier board is connected.

#### Schematic Diagram

##### WisBlock Connector, AMP/DSP Board Connector, and Power Select

TAS2560 needs three power supplies. Analog supply voltage and I/O supply voltage are fixed on RAK18061. The amplifier input power supply can be selected via solder bridges (SB1, SB2, SB3, or SB4). 

<rk-img

  width="100%"
  caption="RAK18061 WisBlock Connector, AMP/DSP Board Connector, and Power Select schematic diagram"
/>

The power supply needs to be selected according to the desired speaker output power:

- **3V3** from the WisBlock Base (maximum output current of 750&nbsp;mA)
- **V<sub>BAT</sub>** from the WisBlock Base (maximum output current of 1&nbsp;A)
- **V<sub>BUS</sub>** from the WisBlock Base (maximum output current of about 1.25&nbsp;A)
- **EX_Power** from an external power supply from J12

:::tip üìù NOTE
If you want to achieve a higher speaker output power, use **EX_Power**. 
  - Voltage at EX_Power should not exceed 5.5&nbsp;V. 
  - Current of EX_Power should be higher than the speaker output power.
