### Hardware

The hardware specification is categorized into six parts. It discusses the interfacing, pinouts, and their corresponding functions and diagrams of the module. It also covers the electrical, mechanical, and environmental characteristics that include the tabular data of the functionalities and standard values of the RAK19013 WisBlock LiPo Solar Power Slot Module.

#### Interfaces

RAK19013 WisBlock LiPo Solar Power Slot Module provides the following interfaces, headers, a button, and WisConnectors:

* 1 WisBlock Power module
* 2 pin battery interface
* 2 pin solar interface
* 3 LEDs
* 1 Reset button

::: tip üìù NOTE
RAK19013 doesn't have a USB connector. So when RAK19013 and RAK19010 are used together, it is not possible to program the core (unless you use Jlink). If you want to program the core, you need the RAK5804. Then you can supply over RAK19013 and program over RAK5804.

::: tip üìù NOTE
The voltage of the battery must not exceed 4.3&nbsp;V.
:::

##### Solar Connector

A 5&nbsp;V Solar panel can be connected to the board via the J2 connector to also serve the purpose of charging the battery. The matching connector for the solar panel wires is an [JST ZHR-2 1.5&nbsp;mm pitch female](https://www.jst-mfg.com/product/detail_e.php?series=287). A cable assembly for the solar panel connector is also available for purchase in [RAK store](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/solar-panel-connector-cable).

**Figure 5** shows the solar connector V+ (VIN) and V- (GND).

##### LEDs

Three LEDs are used to indicate the operating status. Below are the functions of the LEDs:

- üî¥ **Red LED** - Connected to the charger chip to indicate the charger status. When the battery is charging, this red LED is on. When the battery is full, this LED is weak light or off.
- üü¢ **Green LED** - Connected to the MCU module, controlled by MCU defined by the user.
- üîµ **Blue LED** - Connected to the MCU module, controlled by MCU defined by the user.

##### RESET Push Button

The Reset Push Button shown in [**Figure 3**](#interfaces) is connected to the MCU module. When pushed, it resets the MCU.

#### Pin Definition

The RAK19013 module has a 40-pin WisConnector that is compatible to the WisBlock Power Slot. The pin order of the connector and the pinout definition is shown in **Figure 6**.

::: tip üìù NOTE
VBAT, 3V3, RESET, LED1, LED2, ADC_VBAT, and GND are connected to WisIO connector.
