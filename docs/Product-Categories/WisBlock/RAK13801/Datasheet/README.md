# RAK13801 WisBlock UWB Module Datasheet

## Overview


### Description

RAK13801 is a WisBlock IO that extends the WisBlock system based on Decawave's DW1000 module. This module uses a UWB (Ultra Wideband) Technology, a short-range wireless communication similar to Wi-Fi or Bluetooth and it uses a frequency bandwidth above 1&nbsp;GHz. It has an integrated antenna, all RF circuitry, power management, and clock circuitry in one module. It can be used in 2-way ranging or TDOA location systems to locate assets to a precision of 10&nbsp;cm and supports data rates of up to 6.8&nbsp;Mbps.

### Features

  * Power supply: **VBAT**
  * Chipset: **Decawave DW1000**
  * Operating temperature: **-40&nbsp;¬∞C ~ 85&nbsp;¬∞C**
  * Very precise location of tagged objects delivers enterprise efficiency gains and cost reductions
  * Extended communications range minimizes required infrastructure in RTLS
  * High multipath fading immunity
  * Supports very high tag densities in RTLS
  * Low cost allows cost-effective implementation of solutions
  * Low power consumption reduces the need to replace batteries and lowers system lifetime costs
  * **Module size**: 35 x 25&nbsp;mm

## Specifications
