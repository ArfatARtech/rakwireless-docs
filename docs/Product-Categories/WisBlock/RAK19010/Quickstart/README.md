## Product Configuration

### Overview

To give you a better understanding of how the WisBlock Base works, the block diagram and power supply diagram of RAK19010 are provided in this section.

#### Block Diagram

The block diagram shown in **Figure 1** shows the internal architecture and external interfaces of the RAK19010 WisBlock Base Board with Power Slot.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak19010/quickstart/rak19010-block-diagram.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="RAK19010 WisBlock Base Board with Power Slot block diagram"
/>

The WisBlock Power Slot module provides external interfaces to the whole board. RAK19010 will not work without the Power Slot module attached to it.

The MCU in the WisBlock Core module offers the I2C, UART, and SPI data buses to the sensor modules. Through these buses, the MCU can control and retrieve data from the sensors. Some types of MCU have fewer IO pins. In such cases, not all pins of the data bus are connected. For example, only I2C and UART are connected.

Some MCU IO pins have an alternate function. In this case, you have the option to modify the IO via software or rework the hardware to redefine the function of the IO. Refer to the datasheet of WisBlock Core to get all the details.

#### Power Supply Diagram

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak19010/quickstart/rak19010-ps.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="RAK19010 power supply block diagram"
/>

The RAK19010 WisBlock Base board with Power Slot does not have a power regulator or other power-related components. It gets a 3.3&nbsp;V voltage supply and battery voltage supply lines from the Power Slot module attached to it.

RAK19010 supports 3V3_S configurable supply lines to WisBlock modules like other WisBlock Base boards. This is ideal for low-power applications. 3V3_S can be controlled by the MCU to disconnect the power sensors during idle periods to save power. 3V3_S is controlled by the IO2 pin on the WisBlock Core board.

- Set **IO2=1**, 3V3_S is on.
- Set **IO2=0**, 3V3_S is off.

### Hardware Setup

#### RAK19010 WisBlock Base Board with Power Slot Installation Guide

RAK19010 WisBlock Base Board with Power Slot is the main board that allows you to attach a WisBlock Core, power slot module, sensors, and IO modules through the standardized expansion connectors. These connectors provide a data bus interconnection between the modules attached to the RAK19010 Base Board.

This guide shows the details related to the installation of modules into the RAK19010 board. The following section discusses the general concepts to manipulate the WisBlock Connector in any WisBlock Module. The installation and removal details of each type of WisBlock module: Core and Sensor are explained.

##### Attaching a WisBlock Connector

The WisBlock Connector is the interface between the RAK19010 board and the WisBlock Core, Sensor, and IO modules. Before connecting these modules, read the following instructions:

:::tip üìù NOTE:

This guide uses two arrows. Refer to **Figure 3** for its representation.

:::

<rk-img

  caption="Notation within the guide"
/>

1. Align the connectors. Keep the header parallel and place it lightly in the corresponding lap joint of the socket.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak19010/quickstart/2.alignment.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="Alignment of WisBlock Connector"
/>

2. Fit the connector. Tilt one end of the connector (header) less than 20 degrees, while do not apply force during this process, gently place the other end in parallel.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak19010/quickstart/3.header-to-socket.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="Fit the WisBlock Connector‚Äôs header inside of the socket"
/>

3. After the above alignment steps, the header and socket are matched but still not buckled.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak19010/quickstart/4.header-matched.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="WisBlock Connector‚Äôs header matched inside of the socket"
/>

4. Apply forces evenly by pressing in parallel, then there will be a sound confirming the completion of the buckling.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak19010/quickstart/5.buckle-the-head.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="Apply forces to buckle the header to the socket "
/>

5. In the process of buckling and applying force, avoid the application of uneven force on both sides.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak19010/quickstart/6.uneven-forces.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="Avoid applying uneven forces"
/>

6. When the buckling process is completed, check that the header and socket are kept in parallel.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak19010/quickstart/7.buckle-header-to-socket.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="Correct way to buckle the WisBlock Connector‚Äôs header to the socket"
/>

7. If after buckling, the header and socket are not in a parallel state (not fully assembled in one place), then press the even force on both sides of the long side to complete the correct buckling.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak19010/quickstart/8.not-parallel.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="WisBlock Connector‚Äôs header is not parallel to the socket"
/>

8. When the aforementioned steps are not completed yet, do not apply force to buckle. Otherwise, there will be a risk to damage the connector. When the connector cannot be smoothly buckled down, repeat the alignment step.

##### Detaching a WisBlock Connector

1. To disconnect the header from the socket, pull out in parallel with even forces.

  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak19010/quickstart/9.detach-header.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="Correct way: Applying even forces to detach the header from the socket"
/>

2. Avoid pulling out the header asymmetrically in the long-side direction.

  width="60%"
  caption="Wrong way: Applying uneven forces to detach the header from the socket"
/>

3. The short-side of the connector can be pulled out asymmetrically, but apply the force vertically and avoid rotating the header.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak19010/quickstart/11.dont-rotate.png"
  width="60%"
  caption="Wrong way: Do not rotate the header"
/>

4. Avoid applying forces in a single corner.
