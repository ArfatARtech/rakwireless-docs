## Product Description

**RAK19010** is a **WisBlock Base Board with Power Slot** that connects **WisBlock Core** and other **WisBlock Modules**. The power slot of RAK19010 is required to have an attached WisBlock Power Slot module that provides power supply to the core and other modules. There are many different types of power slot modules compatible with RAK19010 and the choice will depend on the type of application.

It has one slot reserved for the power slot module, one for the core module, one slot for the IO module, and four sensor slots A-D for small WisBlock modules. The WisBlock Core, Power, and IO modules are attached on the top side, and smaller WisBlock modules can be attached to the top or bottom side of the RAK19010. Slot A and D hold modules up to 23&nbsp;mm in size, while all slots A up to D support 10&nbsp;mm WisBlock modules. Also, there are three **2.54&nbsp;mm pitch headers** for extension interface with **BOOT**, **GPIO**, **ADC**, **I2C**, and **UART** pins.

WisBlock modules are connected to the RAK19010 WisBlock Base board via high-speed board-to-board connectors. They provide secure and reliable interconnection to ensure the signal integrity of each data bus. A set of screws is used to fix the modules, making it reliable even in an environment with lots of vibrations.

You can also use a [RAK19005 WisBlock Sensor Extension Cable](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/fpc-extension-cable-for-slot-a-to-d-rak19005) or [RAK19008 WisBlock IO Extension Cable](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/wisblock-io-extension-cable-rak19008) to position the WisBlock modules apart from the WisBlock Base board or in any part of your case.

## Product Features

* Flexible building block design, which enables modular function realization and expansion
* High-speed interconnection secured with screws to ensure signal integrity
* Supports multiple types of low-power MCUs
* Supports multiple types of sensors - a single board can support a combination of two different types of sensors
* **Module Slots**
    * 1 WisBlock Core module
    * 1 WisBlock Power Slot module
    * 1 WisBlock module compatible with IO slot
    * 4 WisBlock modules compatible with slots A-D
    * Pin headers accessible pins for BOOT, GPIO, ADC, I2C, and UART interfaces
* **Size**
    * **RAK19010** has a size of only 30 x 60&nbsp;mm, which lets you create solutions that fit into the smallest housings.

## Prerequisites

RAK19010 WisBlock Base Board with Power Slot requires a power slot module to be able to use WisBlock Core and other WisBlock Modules.
