# RAK11310 WisBlock LPWAN Module Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

**RAK11310** is a **WisBlock Core** module for the RAK hardware IoT platform **WisBlock**. It is powered by an RP2040 ARM microcontroller developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation, combined with the SX1262 LoRa transceiver from Semtech. **RAK11310** can be programmed via the Arduino‚Ñ¢ IDE, PlatformIO or MicroPython.

The RAK11310 WisBlock Core module has a RAK11300 LoRa stamp module in it together with a high-quality connector that is compatible with WisBlock Base boards. It allows an easy way to access the pins of the RAK11310 module in order to simplify the development of IoT devices.

The module complies with LoRaWAN 1.0.2 protocols, and also supports LoRa point-to-point communication.

The RF communication characteristic of the Lora module makes it suitable for a variety of applications in the IoT field such as home automation, sensor networks, building automation, personal area networks applications (health/fitness sensors, and monitors, etc.).

- **WisConnector**: The breakout module exposes the RAK11310 stamp module pinout to the board-to-board WisConnector.

- **WisConnector Pin Order**: The pin order of the WisConnector is located on the bottom layer of the module.

- **Core Module**: The breakout module itself has a RAK11310 at its core, and it shows the core module pin and connection information. By default, the NFC function is disabled to preserve the low-power characteristic of this core.

- **SWD Interface**: The breakout module exposes an SWD debug interface. Additionally, the RST pin is used to reset the RAK11310 core module.

- **Power Up Automatic Reset**: The breakout module has a power-up automatic reset circuit, and the schematic shows the automatic reset mechanism. This module also can be reset through the WisBlock Base reset pin.
