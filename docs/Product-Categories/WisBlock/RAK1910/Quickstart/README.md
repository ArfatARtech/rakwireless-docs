# RAK1910 Quick Start Guide

This guide introduces the RAK1910 WisBlock GNSS Location Module and how to program with it. The information obtained from the GPS will then be printed over the USB debug port of the WisBlock Base board.

## Prerequisite

### What Do You Need?

Before going through each and every step on using RAK1910 WisBlock module, make sure to prepare the necessary items listed below:

#### Hardware 

- [RAK1901 and GPS antenna](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-sensor/products/rak1910-max-7q-gnss-location-sensor)
- Your choice of [WisBlock Base](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-base) 
- Your choice of [WisBlock Core](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-core)
- USB Cable
- Li-Ion/LiPo battery (JST PHR-2 2&nbsp;mm female connector)
- Solar charger (optional)

#### Software

- Download and install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
- To add the RAKwireless Core boards on your Arduino board, install the RAKwireless Arduino BSP. Follow the steps in the [Github repo](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index).

## Product Configuration

### Hardware Setup

WisBlock can integrate a GPS receiver which allows to know the exact outside location of the device as well as the current date and time. 

For more information about RAK1910, refer to the [Datasheet](../Datasheet/).

::: tip üìù NOTE: 
Due to the weak GPS signal inside the buildings, it is recommended to use the GPS module outdoors, with a direct line of sight to the sky. This will ensure the necessary signal quality to obtain valid GPS data.
:::

The GPS module gives the following information:

- latitude
- longitude
- altitude
- speed
- direction
- date/time

RAK1910 module can only be connected on **SLOT A** of WisBlock Base to communicate with the WisBlock Core; hence, it will not work on SLOT B to D. Also, always secure the connection of the WisBlock module by using the compatible screw.

#### Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules

##### Assembling

As shown in Figure 2, the location for Slot A, B, C, and D are properly marked by silkscreen. Follow carefully the procedure defined in [RAK5005-O module assembly/disassembly instructions](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK5005-O-Baseboard-Installation-Guide/) in order to attach a WisBlock module. Once attached, carefully fix the module with one or more pieces of M1.2 x 3&nbsp;mm screws depending on the module.

  width="70%"
  caption="RAK1910 connection to WisBlock Base"
/>

##### Disassembling

The procedure in disassembling any type of WisBlock modules is the same. 

1. First, remove the screws.  

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak1910/quickstart/16.removing-screws.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Removing screws from the WisBlock module"
/>

2. Once the screws are removed, check the silkscreen of the module to find the correct location where force can be applier.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak1910/quickstart/17.detaching-silkscreen.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Detaching silkscreen on the WisBlock module"
/>

3. Apply force to the module at the position of the connector, as shown in Figure 5, to detach the module from the baseboard.

#### GPS Antenna

Another important part component of RAK1910 is the GPS antenna. You need to ensure that it is properly connected to have a good GPS signal.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak1910/quickstart/gps_antenna.png"
  width="35%"
  caption="GPS antenna"
/>

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you will connect other modules to the remaining WisBlock Base slots, check on the [WisBlock Pin Mapper](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Pin-Mapper/) tool for possible conflicts. RAK1910 uses UART communication lines and it can cause possible conflict especially on some IO modules. 
:::


After setting up, you can now connect the battery and USB cable to start programming your WisBlock Core.

### Software Configuration and Example

The GPS module starts up by default at 4800&nbsp;bps. This UART speed can be increased using the library functions that have been designed for controlling and managing the module.

The GPS receiver has two operational modes: **NMEA** (National Marine Electronics Association) **Mode** and **Binary Mode**. NMEA mode uses statements from this standard to obtain location, time, and date. The binary mode is based on the sending of structured frames to establish communication between the microcontroller and the GPS receiver, i.e. to read/set ephemeris.

Listed are the different types of NMEA statements that the RAK1910 GPS receiver supports:

- **NMEA GGA**: Provides location data and an indicator of data accuracy.
- **NMEA GSA**: Provides the status of the satellites the GPS receiver has been connected to.
- **NMEA GSV**: Provides information about the satellites the GPS receiver has been connected to.
- **NMEA RMC**: Provides information about the date, time, location, and speed.
- **NMEA VTG**: Provides information about the speed and course of the GPS receiver.
- **NMEA GLL**: Provides information about the location of the GPS receiver.

The most important NMEA statements are the GGA statements which provide a validity indicator of the measurement carried out, the RMC statement which provides location, speed, and date/time, and the GSA statement which provides information about the status of the satellites the GPS receiver has been connected to.

These are the quick links that go directly to the software guide for the specific WisBlock Core module you use.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING    
* The included active GPS antenna must be **securely attached** to the iPEX antenna connector on the board. This is very important, otherwise the module will not work.
* You need to setup the device outdoor. It will take sometime for the device to get stable satellite connectivity. If you will configure it indoor, it will not work.

#### RAK1910 in RAK4631 WisBlock Core Guide

##### Arduino Setup

If you already installed the [RAKwireless Arduino BSP](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index), RAK4631 WisBlock Core board and RAK1910 example code should now be available on the Arduino IDE.

1. You need to select RAK4631 WisBlock Core.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak1910/quickstart/rak4631_board.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Selecting RAK4631 as WisBlock Core"
/>

##### Initial Test of the RAK1910 WisBlock Module

2. The [Basic Sample Code for RAK1910](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/tree/master/examples/common/sensors/RAK1910_GPS_UBLOX7) will work on all WisBlock Core. You can open the example codes depending on your WisBlock Core, as shown in Figure 8. 

<rk-img

  width="100%"
  caption="Opening RAK1910 example for RAK4631 WisBlock Core"
/>

3. Once the example code is open, install the [TinyGPS](https://github.com/neosarchizo/TinyGPS) library by clicking the highlighted link, as shown in Figure 9.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak1910/quickstart/tinygps_lib.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Installing TinyGPS"
/>

4. After the successful installation of the library, you can now select the right port and upload the code, as shown in Figure 10.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak1910/quickstart/select_port.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Opening RAK1910 example for RAK4631 WisBlock Core"
/>

5. When you successfully upload the example sketch, open the Serial Monitor of the Arduino IDE to see the logs. The GPS will try to get a signal fix from satellites, and this will vary depending on your location and if you have a direct line of sight to the sky. It can take few seconds to minutes. If you see the logs, as shown in Figure 11, your RAK1910 is properly communicating to the WisBlock core.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak1910/quickstart/log_scan.png"
  width="80%"
  caption="Scanning GPS signal logs"
/>

6. If everything is successful, you should now see the GPS coordinates on the Serial Monitor of the Arduino IDE, as shown in Figure 12.

::: tip üìù NOTE
It is possible that you will not see the same serial logs in Figure 12 abruptly at your first power up of the unit since the GPS module will still update its almanac and ephemeris data. The time it takes is called TTFF or `Time to first fix`.

It can range to more than 2 minutes depending on how good the satellite signals are in your location. After the almanac and ephemeris are updated, TTFF should be shorter, and getting a GPS signal fix will be faster.

##### RAK1910 LoRaWAN GPS Tracker

For WisBlock Core RAK4630, it has an example for [LoRaWAN GPS Tracker](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/tree/master/examples/RAK4630/solutions/GPS_Tracker). 
   
The following example codes are compatible to LoRaWAN GPS Tracker Kits:

* [LoRaWAN Tracker Kit](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/kits-bundles/products/wisblock-kit-3-gps-tracker)
* [LoRaWAN Tracker Kit with Solar Panel](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/kits-bundles/products/wisblock-kit-2-lora-based-gps-tracker-with-solar-panel)

You also need to have a [RAK1904 (Accelerometer Module)](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak1904-lis3dh-3-axis-acceleration-sensor) on this example since it will trigger the transmission of LoRaWAN packets. You can connect the RAK1904 on SLOT C or SLOT D of the WisBlock Base which is on the other side of the board.

After preparing the hardware, you can now open the example sketch, as shown in Figure 13.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak1910/quickstart/lorawan-gps.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="LoRaWAN GPS Tracker example"
/>

After successful compilation, you should be able to see a successful join request if you are within a compatible gateway and with the right LoRaWAN joining parameters. More information about the LoRaWAN configuration can be found on [Quick Start Guide of RAK4631](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK4631/Quickstart/#configuration-of-lorawan-example-code).

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak1910/quickstart/lorawan_tracker_join.png"
  width="80%"
  caption="Successful upload of GPS Tracker example"
/>

After uploading the code, the device will not automatically send GPS coordinates but only when a specific orientation is achieved. The following part of the code will trigger the sending of LoRaWAN packets.
```
data = "";
if (abs(x - z) < 400)
```
If the absolute value of the difference between the X and Z axis is less than 400, the LoRaWAN packets will be transmitted to the LoRaWAN network server. Physically, you can trigger this condition by positioning the WisBlock upright with the USB connector either at the top or at the bottom. You can create your own conditions too when to transmit the LoRaWAN Payload.

::: tip üìù NOTE
There will be no LoRaWAN transmissions if there is no GPS signal found and if the accelerometer is not in the right orientation.
:::

GPS signal can take a few seconds or minutes to get a good fix depending on your location and situation. If all are successful after waiting for the GPS signal, you should now see this on the serial monitor/terminal.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak1910/quickstart/lorawan_tracker_transmit.png"
  width="85%"
  caption="LoRaWAN GPS Coordinate Sent"
/>

The packet should also arrive at the LoRaWAN¬Æ network server you use. The values you see will not make sense and don't look like GPS coordinates. It is normal because the payload is not decoded yet.

If you are using Chirpstack, you will see the packet as shown in Figure 16. 

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak1910/quickstart/chirpstack_nodecode.png"
  width="40%"
  caption="Chirpstack LoRaWAN payload"
/>

If you are using The Things Stack (TTN V3), you will see the packet as shown in Figure 17. 

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak1910/quickstart/ttn_notdecoded.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="TTS LoRaWAN payload"
/>

##### Payload Decoding of LoRaWAN GPS Tracker

###### Data format

Data sent to LoRaWan¬Æ server of the example code has the following format:

- Buffer[0] - 0x09 (Header indicator that the data is the GPS coordinate).
- Buffer[1-4] - Latitude value in integer. To get the actual latitude value in float, this integer must be divided by 10000. This can be done on the payload decoder side.
- Buffer[5] - It can be 'S' or 'N' which pertains to geographical location.
- Buffer[6-9] - Latitude value in integer. To get the actual latitude value in float, this integer must be divided by 10000. This can be done on the payload decoder side.
- Buffer[10] - It can be 'E' or 'W' which pertains to geographical location.

###### Chirpstack Decoder

Here is the payload decoder that you can use for Chirpstack.
```C
function Decode(fport, bytes) 
{
  var longitude_int, latitude_int;
  var decoded = {"latitude":"","longitude":""};
  
  if (fport === 2)
  {
    if(bytes[0]==9) // check if the header byte is 9.
    {
      latitude_int = (bytes[1] << 24) | (bytes[2] << 16) | (bytes[3] << 8) | (bytes[4]);
      decoded.latitude = latitude_int / 100000;
      longitude_int = (bytes[6] << 24) | (bytes[7] << 16) | (bytes[8] << 8) | (bytes[9]);
      decoded.longitude = longitude_int / 100000;
      return decoded;
    }
  }
}
```
After modifying the decoder in Chirpstack, you can now see the GPS coordinates value of latitude and longitude.

If you got the right payload, the decoded payload should look like in Figure 18.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak1910/quickstart/chirpstack_decoded.png"
  width="30%"
  caption="Chirpstack decoded GPS payload"
/>

###### TTS Decoder

Here is the payload decoder that you can use for TTS.
```C
function Decoder(bytes, port) 
{
  var longitude_int, latitude_int;
  var decoded = {};
  
  if (port === 2)
  {
    if(bytes[0]==9) // check if the header byte is 9.
    {
      latitude_int = (bytes[1] << 24) | (bytes[2] << 16) | (bytes[3] << 8) | (bytes[4]);
      decoded.latitude = latitude_int / 100000;
      longitude_int = (bytes[6] << 24) | (bytes[7] << 16) | (bytes[8] << 8) | (bytes[9]);
      decoded.longitude = longitude_int / 100000;
      return decoded;
    }
  }
}
```
After modifying the decoder in TTS, you can now see the GPS coordinates value of latitude and longitude.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak1910/quickstart/ttn_decoded.png"
  width="95%"
  caption="TTS Decoded GPS payload"
/>
###### Timing

In this LoRaWAN GPS example, checking of an accelerometer is in a period of 10 seconds. On actual LoRaWAN deployment, this should be much higher to follow the regulations stated on the LoRaWAN Regional Parameters specifications.

If there is no GPS coordinate transmission even if you are sure that the accelerometer is already in the right trigger orientation `if (abs(x - z) < 400)`, then you need to check the RAK1910 GPS module if you can get GPS signal. Perform the [initial RAK1910 quick test](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK1910/Quickstart/#initial-test-of-the-rak1910-wisblock-module).
