## Product Description

The RAK1910 WisBlock GNSS Location Module module, part of the RAK Wireless Wisblock series, is a u-blox MAX-7Q GNSS (GPS, GLONASS, QZSS, and SBAS) module. This module features exceptional performance, high sensitivity, and minimal acquisition time, which makes it suitable for low-power IoT solutions. The RAK1910 positioning module is a GNSS receiver. It receives and tracks the GPS (including SBAS and QZSS) and the GLONASS signals. QZSS and SBAS signals (by default) can be received concurrently with GPS signals.

* **Size**
    * 10 x 23&nbsp;mm

## Prerequisites

To use a **RAK1910**, you need at least a **WisBlock Base** and a **GPS Antenna** to plug the module in. **WisBlock Base** provides power supply to the **RAK1910** module. Furthermore, you need a **WisBlock Core** module to use the sensor.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
* The included active GPS antenna must be connected to the iPEX antenna connector on the board. Otherwise, the module will not work.
* Make sure to fix the module with the screws to ensure a proper function.
