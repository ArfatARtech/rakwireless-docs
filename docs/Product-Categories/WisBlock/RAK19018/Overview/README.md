## Product Description

The RAK19018 is a Power-over-Ethernet module used together with the RAK13800 Ethernet Interface module to draw power from CAT5/CAT6 cables. This PoE module is based on the Silvertel Ag9905MT converter board and compatible with the IEEE 802.3af PoE standard.

The Ag9905MT's signature and control circuit provide the PoE compatibility requirement by the Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE) before applying up to 9&nbsp;Watts of power to the port. This provides a Class 0 signature.

The DC/DC converter operates over a wide input voltage from 36&nbsp;V to 57&nbsp;V and provides a regulated 5&nbsp;V output with built-in short-circuit output protection.
