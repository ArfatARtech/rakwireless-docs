## Product Description

The RAK1902 WisBlock Barometer Pressure Sensor Module, part of the RAK Wireless WisBlock series, is an ultra-compact piezo-resistive pressure sensor that functions as a digital barometer with an I2C interface. The sensing element, which detects absolute pressure, consists of a suspended membrane manufactured through a delicate process developed by ST¬Æ. The pressure measurement covers the range from 260&nbsp;hPa to 1260&nbsp;hPa and the temperature measurement covers the range from -40&nbsp;¬∞C to 85&nbsp;¬∞C. Measurements accuracy is ¬±0.1&nbsp;hPa for pressure and ¬±1.5&nbsp;¬∞C for temperature.
