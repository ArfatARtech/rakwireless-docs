# Quick Start Guide

<!--
## Introduction

This guide introduces the WisBlock Sensor RAK1902 Barometer board and how to program with it.

The information obtained from the barometer pressure will then be printed over the USB debug port of the WisBlock Base board.

-->

## Prerequisite

### What Do You Need?

Before going through each and every step on using RAK1902 WisBlock module, make sure to prepare the necessary items listed below:

#### Hardware

- [RAK1902](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-sensor/products/rak1902-kps22hb-barometric-pressure-sensor)
- Your choice of [WisBlock Base](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-base) 
- Your choice of [WisBlock Core](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-core)
- USB Cable
- Li-Ion/LiPo battery (optional)
- Solar charger (optional)

#### Software

- Download and install [ArduinoIDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
- To add the RAKwireless Core boards on your Arduino board, install the RAKwireless Arduino BSP. Follow the steps in the [Github repo](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index).

## Product Configuration

### Hardware Setup

WisBlock can integrate this module which calculates temperature and makes it easy to build up a barometric air pressure data acquisition system. 

For more information about RAK1902, refer to the [Datasheet](../Datasheet/).

The RAK1902 module gives us information about:

- Barometric Pressure
- Environment Temperature

RAK1902 module can be connected on any slot of WisBlock Base to communicate with the WisBlock Core. It will work on **SLOT A to D**. Also, always secure the connection of the WisBlock module by using the compatible screws.

#### Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules

##### Assembling

As shown in **Figure 2**, the location for Slot A, B, C, and D are properly marked by silkscreen. Follow carefully the procedure defined in [RAK5005-O module assembly/disassembly instructions](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK5005-O-Baseboard-Installation-Guide/) to attach a WisBlock module. Once attached, carefully fix the module with one or more pieces of M1.2 x 3&nbsp;mm screws depending on the module.

/>

##### Disassembling

The procedure in disassembling any type of WisBlock modules is the same. 

1. First, remove the screws.

2. Once the screws are removed, check the silkscreen of the module to find the correct location where force can be applied.

3. Apply force to the module at the position of the connector, as shown in **Figure 5**, to detach the module from the baseboard.

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you will connect other modules to remaining WisBlock Base slots, check on the [WisBlock Pin Mapper](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Pin-Mapper/) tool for possible conflicts. RAK1902 uses I2C communication lines, and it can cause possible conflict especially on some IO modules. 
:::


After all this setup, you can now connect the battery and USB cable to start programming your WisBlock Core.

### Software Configuration and Example

The RAK1902 is a pressure sensor board that contains LPS22HB chip. The LPS22HB is an ultra-compact piezoresistive absolute pressure sensor that functions as a digital output barometer. The device comprises a sensing element and an IC interface which communicates through I2C from the sensing element to the application.

#### Initial Test of the RAK1902 WisBlock Module

If you already installed the [RAKwireless Arduino BSP](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index), the WisBlock Core and example code should now be available on the Arduino IDE.

1. You need to select first the WisBlock Core you have, as shown in **Figure 6** and **Figure 7**.

  width="100%"

/>

2. The [Basic Sample Code for RAK1902](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/tree/master/examples/common/sensors/RAK1902_Pressure_LPS22HB) in Github will work on all WisBlock Core. You can open the the example codes depending on your WisBlock Core, as shown in **Figure 8** and **Figure 9**.

  width="100%"
  caption="Opening RAK1902 example code for RAK11200 WisBlock Core"
/>

3. Once the example code is open, install the [Adafruit LPS2X](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_LPS2X) library by clicking the yellow highlighted link, as shown in **Figure 10** and **Figure 11**.

4. After successful installation of the library, you can now select the right serial port and upload the code, as shown in **Figure 12** and **Figure 13**.

  width="100%"
  caption="Uploading the RAK1902 example code"
/>

5. When you successfully uploaded the example sketch, open the Serial Monitor of the Arduino IDE to see the sensor's reading logs. If you see the logs, as shown in **Figure 14**, then your RAK1902 is properly communicating to the WisBlock core.

#### LoRaWAN Weather Monitoring with RAK1902

For WisBlock Core RAK4630, it has an example for [LoRaWAN Weather Monitoring](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/tree/master/examples/RAK4630/solutions/Weather_Monitoring) with RAK1902 Pressure Module.
