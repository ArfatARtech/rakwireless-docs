## Specifications

### Overview 

#### Mounting

The RAK12012 Heart Rate module can be mounted to IO slot of the WisBlock Base board. **Figure 1** shows the mounting mechanism of the RAK12012 on a WisBlock Base board, such as the [RAK5005-O](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak5005-o-base-board).

### Hardware

The hardware specification is categorized into five parts. It shows the chipset of the module and discusses the pinouts and its corresponding functions and diagrams. It also covers the electrical and mechanical parameters that include the tabular data of the functionalities and standard values of the RAK12012 WisBlock Heart Rate Module.

#### Chipset

| Vendor           | Part number |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| Maxim Integrated | MAX30102    |


#### Pin Definition

The RAK12012 WisBlock Heart Rate module comprises a standard WisIO connector. The WisIO connector allows the RAK12012 module to be mounted to a WisBlock baseboard, such as RAK5005-O. The pin order of the connector and the pinout definition is shown in **Figure 3**. 

 
::: tip üìù NOTE
- **I2C** related pins: **INT**,**3V3_S**, and **GND** are connected to WisIO connector.
- The **3V3_S** supply can be disconnected to save power via **WB_IO2**.

#### Schematic Diagram

##### Power Supply

**Figure 6** shows the MAX30102 power supply. The IC uses 1.8&nbsp;V as voltage supply source generated by SGM2019-1.8YN5G/TR (LDO). The VLED+ has a different dedicated power supply coming from the 3V3_S of the WisBlock Base board.

/>


##### Voltage Level Transfer

The MAX30102 IO voltage is 1.8&nbsp;V and the CPU module voltage is 3.3&nbsp;V, so the voltage level transfer is needed. Pull-up Resistor for I2C_SCL and I2C_SDA already exist on WisBlock Base boardÔºåso there is no need to connectÔºàNCÔºâon IO module such as RAK12012.

##### MAX30105EFD+T Circuit

INT is an active-low interrupt (Open-Drain). This needs to be connected to an external voltage with a pull-up resistor **R7**.
