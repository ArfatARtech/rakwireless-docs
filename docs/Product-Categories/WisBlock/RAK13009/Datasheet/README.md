# RAK13009 WisBlock QWIIC Module Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

The RAK13009 is a QWIIC module, which is part of the RAKWireless WisBlock Interface series. This module has two connectors: one for the WisBlock sensor and then for the standard QWIIC interface. By using this module you can plug any QWIIC interface module into the WisBlock sensor and use it just like any other WisBlock sensor.


### Features

 - WisBlock Sensor module
 - Standard QWIIC interface
 - Module Size: 10&nbsp;mm x 10&nbsp;mm

## Specifications

### Overview 

#### Mounting

The RAK13009 WisBlock QWIIC can be mounted to the IO slot of the WisBlock Base board. **Figure 1** shows the mounting mechanism of the RAK13009 on a WisBlock Base board, such as the [RAK5005-O](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak5005-o-base-board).

### Hardware

The hardware specification is categorized into four parts. It shows the pinouts and their corresponding functions and diagrams. It also covers the electrical and mechanical parameters that include the tabular data of the functionalities and standard values of the RAK13009 WisBlock QWIIC Module.

#### Pin Definition

The RAK13009 WisBlock QWIIC comprises a standard WisBlock sensor connector. The WisBlock sensor connector allows the RAK13009 module to be mounted to a WisBlock baseboard, such as RAK5005-O. The pin order of the connector and the pinout definition is shown in **Figure 2**.
