# RAK14006 Quick Start Guide

## Prerequisite

### What Do You Need?

Before going through each and every step on using the RAK14006 WisBlock Rotary Encoder module, make sure to prepare the necessary items listed below:

#### Hardware

- [RAK14006 WisBlock Rotary Encoder Module](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/wisblock-heart-rate-sensor-rak14006)
- Your choice of [WisBlock Base](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-base) 
- Your choice of [WisBlock Core](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-core)
- USB Cable
- [RAK19008 WisBlock IO Extension Cable](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/wisblock-io-extension-cable-rak19008)
- [Li-Ion/LiPo battery (optional)](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK5005-O/Datasheet/#battery-connector)
- [Solar charger (optional)](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK5005-O/Datasheet/#solar-panel-connector)

#### Software

- Download and install [ArduinoIDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
- To add the RAKwireless Core boards on your Arduino Boards Manager, install the [RAKwireless Arduino BSP](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index).

## Product Configuration

### Hardware Setup

The RAK14006 is a rotary encoder module with PEC11L-4125F-S0020 from BOURNS. RAK14006 can detect user inputs such as rotation direction and rotation number of steps. Also, an independent push switch is provided. For more information about RAK14006, refer to the [Datasheet](../Datasheet/).

The RAK14006 WisBlock Rotary Encoder Module can be mounted on the IO slot of the WisBlock Base board, as shown in **Figure 1**. Also, always secure the connection of the WisBlock module by using compatible screws.

#### Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules

##### Assembling


As shown in **Figure 2**, the location for the IO slot is properly marked by silkscreen. Follow carefully the procedure defined in [RAK5005-O module assembly/disassembly instructions](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK5005-O-Baseboard-Installation-Guide/) to attach a WisBlock module. Once attached, carefully fix the module with three pieces of M1.2 x 3&nbsp;mm screws.

  caption="RAK14006 assembly to WisBlock Base"
/>

##### Disassembling

The procedure in disassembling any type of WisBlock modules is the same. 

1. First, remove the screws.  

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak14006/quickstart/removing_screw.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Removing screws from the WisBlock module"
/>

2. Once the screws are removed, check the silkscreen of the module to find the correct location where force can be applied.

3. Apply force to the module at the position of the connector, as shown in **Figure 5**, to detach the module from the baseboard.

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you will connect other modules to the remaining WisBlock Base slots, check on the [WisBlock Pin Mapper](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Pin-Mapper/) tool for possible conflicts. 
:::  

After all this setup, you can now connect the battery (optional) and USB cable to start programming your WisBlock Core.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

- Batteries can cause harm if not handled properly.
- Only 3.7-4.2&nbsp;V Rechargeable LiPo batteries are supported. It is highly recommended not to use other types of batteries with the system unless you know what you are doing.
- If a non-rechargeable battery is used, it has to be unplugged first before connecting the USB cable to the USB port of the board to configure the device. Not doing so might damage the battery or cause a fire.
- Only 5&nbsp;V solar panels are supported. Do not use 12&nbsp;V solar panels. It will destroy the charging unit and eventually other electronic parts.
- Make sure the battery wires match the polarity on the RAK5005-O board. Not all batteries have the same wiring.

### Software Configuration and Example

In this example, you will be getting the rotation position of the knob or if it is pressed to your Serial Monitor.

1. You need to select first the WisBlock Core you have, as shown in **Figure 6** to **Figure 8**.

  press_flag = true;
}
void handle_2(){

}
```

If you experience any error in compiling the example sketch, check the updated code for the RAK14006 WisBlock Rotary Encoder Module that can be found on the [RAK14006 WisBlock Example Code Repository](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/blob/master/examples/common/IO/RAK14006_Rotary_Encoder/RAK14006_Rotary_Encoder.ino)


3. Select the right serial port and upload the code, as shown in **Figure 9** and **Figure 10**.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
RAK11200 requires the BOOT0 pin to be configured properly before uploading. If not done properly, uploading the source code to RAK11200 will fail. Check the full details on the [RAK11200 Quick Start Guide](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK11200/Quickstart/#uploading-to-wisblock).

5. When you successfully upload the sample code, you may rotate or press the knob switch of RAK14006, as shown in **Figure 13**. Then, you can open up your serial monitor to get the rotary encoder reading, as shown in **Figure 14**.
