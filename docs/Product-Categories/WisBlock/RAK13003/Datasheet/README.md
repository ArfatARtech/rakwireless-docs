### Hardware

The hardware specification is categorized into five parts. It shows the chipset of the module and discusses the pinouts and its corresponding functions and diagrams. It also covers the electrical and mechanical parameters that include the tabular data of the functionalities and standard values of the RAK13003 WisBlock IO Expansion Module.

#### Chipset

The RAK13003 IO Expansion Module uses MCP23017 from Microchip. 

| Vendor    | Part Number |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Microchip | MCP23017    |

Figure 2 shows MCP23017 device addressing. Default A2, A1, and A0 are connected to ground. 7-Bits I2C address is 0x40.
