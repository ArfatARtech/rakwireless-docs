## Product Configuration

### Overview

To give you a better understanding of how the WisBlock Base works, the block diagram, data bus, and power supply diagram of RAK5005-O are provided in this section.

#### Block Diagram

The block diagram, shown in **Figure 1**, shows the internal architecture and external interfaces of the RAK5005-O board.

#### Data Bus of RAK5005-O

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak5005-o/datasheet/9.bus-data.png"
  width="80%"
  caption="RAK5005-O WisBlock Base Data Bus"
/>

The MCU in the WisBlock Core module offers the I2C, UART, and SPI data buses to the sensor modules. Through these buses, the MCU can control and retrieve data from the sensors. In addition, the IO module connects to the USB, GPIO, and ADC buses allowing you to access all of the MCU interfaces.

Some types of MCU have fewer IO pins. In such cases, not all the pins of the data bus are connected. For example, only I2C and UART are connected. Some MCU IO pins have an alternate function. Then you can modify its function by software or rework the hardware to redefine the function of IO. Refer to the datasheet of WisBlock Core to get all the details.

#### Power Supply Diagram of RAK5005-O

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak5005-o/datasheet/10.power-supply.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Power Supply Block Diagram"
/>

The RAK5005-O is designed to be powered by a battery and provides the charger circuitry for **lithium batteries**. The charger circuitry can be connected to a wall outlet charger through the micro USB connector, or the specific connector for a solar panel.

A low quiescent current LDO is used for generating 3.3&nbsp;V. This 3.3&nbsp;V power supply drives the consumption of the WisBlock Core module the sensor modules, and the IO module directly. The max current supported by the 3.3&nbsp;V LDO is 750&nbsp;mA.

VDD is generated by the MCU module to drive sensor and IO modules. The MCUs are usually powered by the 3.3&nbsp;V, and can provide different levels of voltage: 3.3&nbsp;V, 2.5&nbsp;V, and 1.8&nbsp;V to their IO pins through regulators in the WisBlock Core board.

3V3_S is another 3.3&nbsp;V power supply, it can be controlled by the MCU in order to disconnect the power sensors during idle periods to save power. 3V3_S is controlled by an IO2 pin on the WisBlock Core board. 

- Set **IO2=1**, 3V3_S is on.
- Set **IO2=0**, 3V3_S is off.


### Hardware Setup

#### RAK5005-O WisBlock Base Board Installation Guide

RAK5005-O WisBlock Base Board is the main board that allows you to attach MCU, sensors, and IO modules through the standardized expansion connectors. These connectors provide a data bus interconnection between the modules attached to the RAK5005-O Base Board.

This guide shows the details related to the installation of modules into the RAK5005-O board. The following section discusses the general concepts to manipulate the WisConnector in any WisBlock. The installation and removal details of each type of WisBlock module: Core, Sensor, and IO are explained. 

##### Attaching a WisConnector

The WisConnector is the interface between the RAK5005-O module and the WisBlock Core, Sensor, and IO modules. Before connecting these modules, read the following instructions.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

This guide uses two arrows. Refer to **Figure 4** for its representation.

:::

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak5005-o/quickstart/1.arrows.png"
  width="50%"
  caption="Notation within the guide"
/>

1. Align the connectors. Keep the header parallel and place it lightly in the corresponding lap joint of the socket.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak5005-o/quickstart/2.alignment.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="Alignment of WisConnector"
/>

2. Fit the connector. Tilt one end of the connector (header) less than 20 degrees, while do not apply force during this process, gently place the other end in parallel.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak5005-o/quickstart/3.header-to-socket.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="Fit the WisConnector‚Äôs header inside of the socket"
/>

3. After the above alignment steps, the header and socket are matched, but still not buckled.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak5005-o/quickstart/4.header-matched.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="WisConnector‚Äôs header matched inside of the socket"
/>

4. Apply forces evenly by pressing in parallel, then there will be a sound confirming the completion of the buckling.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak5005-o/quickstart/5.buckle-the-head.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="Apply forces to buckle the heard to the socket "
/>

5. In the process of buckling and applying force, avoid the application of uneven force on both sides.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak5005-o/quickstart/6.uneven-forces.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="Avoid applying uneven forces "
/>

6. When the buckling process is completed, check that the header and socket are kept in parallel.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak5005-o/quickstart/7.buckle-header-to-socket.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="Correct way to buckle the WisConnector‚Äôs header to the socket"
/>

7. If after buckling, the header and socket are not in a parallel state (not fully assembled in one place), then press the even force on both sides of the long side to complete the correct buckling.


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak5005-o/quickstart/8.not-parallel.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="WisConnector‚Äôs header is not parallel to the socket"
/>

8. When the aforementioned steps are not completed yet, do not apply force to buckle. Otherwise, there will be a risk to damage the connector. When the connector cannot be smoothly buckled down, repeat the alignment step. 

##### Detaching a WisConnector

1. To disconnect the header from the socket, pull out in parallel with even forces.

  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak5005-o/quickstart/9.detach-header.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="Correct way: Applying even forces to detach the header from the socket"
/>

2. Avoid pulling out the header asymmetrically in the long-side direction.

  width="60%"
  caption="Wrong way: Applying uneven forces to detach the header from the socket"
/>

3. The short-side of the connector can be pulled out asymmetrically, but apply the force vertically and avoid rotating the header.

  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak5005-o/quickstart/11.dont-rotate.png"
  width="60%"
  caption="Wrong way: Do not rotate the header"
/>

4. Avoid applying forces in a single corner.
