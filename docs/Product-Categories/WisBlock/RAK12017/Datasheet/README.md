# RAK12017 WisBlock IR Detection Sensor Module Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

The RAK12017 is an IR detection module. This module uses ITR20001 optical switch from Everlight to detect whether the IR Signal reflects. Sample applications of this module are: to identify if an object is approaching and check changes between black and white lines.


### Features

- Detect whether IR Signal is reflected back
- ŒªP=940&nbsp;nm
- 3.3&nbsp;V Power supply
- Current Consumption: < 21&nbsp;mA
- Chipset: Everlight ITR20001
- Infrared Line Tracking Range: 1&nbsp;cm to 5&nbsp;cm
- Module Size: 15&nbsp;mm x 25&nbsp;mm

## Specifications

### Overview

#### Mounting

The RAK12017 WisBlock IR Detection Sensor Module can be mounted to the IO slot of the [WisBlock Base](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/#wisblock-base) board. **Figure 1** shows the mounting mechanism of the RAK12017 on a WisBlock Base module.

::: tip üìù NOTE
- **3V3_S** is supported by WisBase.
- **AIN1** is an analog input.
- The voltage depends on reflection strength.
- The reverse level of MCP606 can be adjusted by indicator.
- **D1** is an LED used as an indicator light.
- **J2** is used for cable when the module is out of the base.
