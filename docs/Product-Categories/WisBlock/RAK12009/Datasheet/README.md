##### Alcohol Detector Circuit

**Figure 6** shows the alcohol detector circuit.

* **U2** is the MQ-3B Alcohol sensor.
* The pin 2 voltage (5&nbsp;V) is used to supply standard working temperature to the sensor. 
* **AOUT** is the voltage of load resistance R12 which is in series with sensor.
* The pin 1 and pin 3 voltage (5&nbsp;V) supply the detect voltage to load resistance R12.
* **U3** is a 12-bit analog-to-digital converter with alert function. The **U3** power supply is 5&nbsp;V.

##### Voltage Level Shifter Circuit

The 40-pin WisConnector voltage level is 3.3&nbsp;V, while U2 and U3 levels are 5&nbsp;V. To interface the different voltage levels between 40-pin WisConnector and Alcohol detector circuit, the RAK12009 uses a built-in voltage level shifter circuit.

##### I2C Address

The I2C address of the Analog-to-Digital converter chip of RAK12009 can be selected via resistor jumpers, as shown in **Figure 8**.
