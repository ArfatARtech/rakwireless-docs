# RAK12009 Quick Start Guide
## Prerequisite

### What Do You Need?

Before going through each and every step on using the RAK12009 WisBlock MQ3 Alcohol Gas Sensor Module, make sure to prepare the necessary items listed below:

#### Hardware

- [RAK12009](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/mq2-gas-sensor-module-rak12004)
- Your choice of [WisBlock Base](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-base) 
- Your choice of [WisBlock Core](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-core)
- USB Cable
- [Li-Ion/LiPo battery](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-accessory/products/battery-connector-cable) (required)
- [Solar charger](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-accessory/products/solar-panel-connector-cable) (optional)

#### Software

- Download and install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
- To add the RAKwireless Core boards on your Arduino project, install the RAKwireless Arduino BSP. Follow the steps in the [RAKwireless Arduino BSP](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index).

## Product Configuration

### Hardware Setup

RAK12009 module is a part of the WisBlock Sensor category that extends the WisBlock system with a gas sensor alert system. The RAK12009 connects to the WisBlock Base Board through the IO slot. **Figure 1** shows the assembly of a [WisBlock Core](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-core) (highlighted in green) and the module RAK12009 (highlighted in red). Also, always secure the connection of the WisBlock module by using the compatible screws. For more information about RAK12009, refer to the [Datasheet](../Datasheet/).

#### Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules

##### Assembling

As shown in **Figure 2**, the location for the IO slot is properly marked by silkscreen. Follow carefully the procedure defined in [RAK5005-O module assembly/disassembly instructions](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK5005-O-Baseboard-Installation-Guide/) to attach a WisBlock module. Once attached, carefully fix the module with one or more pieces of M1.2 x 3&nbsp;mm screws depending on the module.

  width="70%"
  caption="RAK12009 connection to WisBlock Base Board"
/>

##### Disassembling

The procedure in disassembling any type of WisBlock modules is the same. 

1. First, remove the screws.  

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak12009/quickstart/16.removing-screws.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Removing screws from the WisBlock module"
/>

2. Once the screws are removed, check the silkscreen of the module to find the correct location where force can be applied.

  width="70%"
  caption="Detaching silkscreen on the WisBlock module"

3. Apply force to the module at the position of the connector, as shown in **Figure 5**, to detach the module from the baseboard.

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you will connect other modules to the remaining WisBlock Base slots, check on the [WisBlock Pin Mapper](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Pin-Mapper/) tool for possible conflicts. RAK12009 uses I2C and IO pins. It can cause possible conflict, especially on some IO modules. 
:::


After all this setup, you can now connect the battery and USB cable to start programming your WisBlock Core.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

- Battery can cause harm if not handled properly.
- Only 3.7-4.2&nbsp;V Rechargeable LiPo batteries are supported. It is highly recommended not to use other types of batteries with the system unless you know what you are doing.
- If a non-rechargeable battery is used, it has to be unplugged first before connecting the USB cable to the USB port of the board to configure the device. Not doing so might damage the battery or cause fire.
- Make sure the battery wires are matching the polarity on the RAK WisBlock Base Board. Not all batteries have the same wiring.
- Only 5&nbsp;V solar panels are supported. Do not use 12&nbsp;V solar panels. It will destroy the charging unit and eventually other electronic parts.
:::

### Software Configuration and Example

The RAK12009 has an electronic sensor used for sensing the concentration of gases in the air. It contains a sensing material whose resistance changes when it comes in contact with the gas. Concentrations of the gas are measured using a voltage divider network present in the sensor. The output of the sensing element is connected to a 12-bit ADC (ADC121C021) which communicates through I2C to the application.
