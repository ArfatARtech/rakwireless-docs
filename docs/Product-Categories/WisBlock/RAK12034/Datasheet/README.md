# RAK12034 WisBlock 9-Axis Accelerometer Module Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

The RAK12034 is a 9-axis accelerometer module, part of the RAKwireless WisBlock Sensor series. It is based on BMX160 Bosch Sensor, which is a highly integrated low-power 9-axis sensor providing precise acceleration, angular rate, and geomagnetic measurement in each spatial direction.

Due to its small form factor and low-power consumption, it is ideal for smart wearables. Moreover, you can also use the BSX sensor data fusion software library of Bosch Sensortec to tweak the sensor's performance.

### Possible Applications

- Virtual and augmented reality
- Indoor navigation
- 3D scanning/indoor mapping
- Advanced gesture recognition
- Immersive gaming
- 9-axis motion detection
- Air mouse applications and pointers
- Pedometer/step counting
- Advanced system power management for mobile applications
- Optical image stabilization of camera modules
- Free-fall detection and warranty logging

### Features

- Very low power consumption: typ. 1585&nbsp;ŒºA in high performance mode
- Selectable acceleration range: ¬±2&nbsp;g to ¬±16&nbsp;g
- Gyroscope range: 125&nbsp;¬∞/s to 2000&nbsp;¬∞/s
- Magnetic field range x/y ¬±1300&nbsp;ŒºT, z ¬±2500&nbsp;ŒºT
- 3.3&nbsp;V Power supply
- Operating temperature: -40&nbsp;¬∞C ~ 105&nbsp;¬∞C

### Hardware

The hardware specification is categorized into five parts. It presents the coordinate system, pinouts and the corresponding functions and diagrams of the module. It also covers the electrical and mechanical characteristics that include the tabular data of the functionalities and standard values of the RAK12034 9-Axis Accelerometer Module.

#### Pin Definition

The RAK12034 comprises a standard WisBlock Sensor connector. The WisBlock Sensor connector allows the **RAK12034** module to be mounted on WisBlock Base board, such as RAK5005-O.

The pin order of the connector and the pinout definition are shown in **Figure 2**.

#### Schematic Diagram

By default, the **AP_AD0** pin is connected to VCC. And the default I2C address of the 9-Axis accelerometer is 1101001.
**R2** and **R3** are not needed in RAK12034 due to pull-up resistors existing on the WisBlock Base board.
