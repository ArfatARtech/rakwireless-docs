## Product Description

The RAK12034 is a 9-axis accelerometer module, part of the RAKwireless WisBlock Sensor series. It is based on BMX160 Bosch Sensor, which is a highly integrated low-power 9-axis sensor providing precise acceleration, angular rate, and geomagnetic measurement in each spatial direction.

Due to its small form factor and low-power consumption, it is ideal for smart wearables. Moreover, you can also use the BSX sensor data fusion software library of Bosch Sensortec to tweak the sensor's performance.
