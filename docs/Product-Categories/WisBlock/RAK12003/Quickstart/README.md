# Quick Start Guide

<!--
## Introduction

This guide introduces the WisBlock RAK12003 Infrared Temperature Sensor and how to program with it.

The information obtained from the infrared temperature sensor will then be printed over the USB debug port of the WisBlock Base board.

-->

## Prerequisite

### What Do You Need?

Before going through each and every step on using RAK12003 WisBlock module, make sure to prepare the necessary items listed below:

#### Hardware

- [RAK12003](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-sensor/products/infrared-temperature-sensor-rak12003)
- Your choice of [WisBlock Base](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-base) 
- Your choice of [WisBlock Core](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-core)
- USB Cable
- Li-Ion/LiPo battery (optional)
- Solar charger (optional)

#### Software

- Download and install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
- To add the RAKwireless Core boards on your Arduino board, install the RAKwireless Arduino BSP. Follow the steps in the [Github repo](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index).

## Product Configuration

### Hardware Setup

WisBlock can integrate this module which extends the WisBlock system with an infrared temperature sensor. 

For more information about RAK12003, refer to the [Datasheet](../Datasheet/).

The RAK12003 module gives us information about:

- Object temperatures between -20&nbsp;¬∞C and 100&nbsp;¬∞C
- Accuracy ¬±0.2&nbsp;¬∞C within the narrow object temperature range from 35&nbsp;¬∞C to 42&nbsp;¬∞C (medical applications)

RAK12003 module can be connected on any slot of WisBlock Base to communicate with the WisBlock Core. It will work on **SLOT A to D**. Also, always secure the connection of the WisBlock module by using the compatible screws.

#### Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules

##### Assembling

As shown in **Figure 2**, the location for Slot A, B, C, and D are properly marked by silkscreen. Follow carefully the procedure defined in [RAK5005-O module assembly/disassembly instructions](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK5005-O-Baseboard-Installation-Guide/) to attach a WisBlock module. Once attached, carefully fix the module with one or more pieces of M1.2 x 3&nbsp;mm screws depending on the module.

/>

##### Disassembling

The procedure in disassembling any type of WisBlock modules is the same. 

1. First, remove the screws.

2. Once the screws are removed, check the silkscreen of the module to find the correct location where force can be applied.

3. Apply force to the module at the position of the connector, as shown in **Figure 5**, to detach the module from the baseboard.

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you will connect other modules to remaining WisBlock Base slots, check on the [WisBlock Pin Mapper](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Pin-Mapper/) tool for possible conflicts. RAK12003 uses I2C communication lines, and it can cause possible conflict especially on some IO modules.

After all this setup, you can now connect the battery and USB cable to start programming your WisBlock Core.

### Software Configuration and Example

The RAK12003 WisBlock Infrared Temperature Sensor is part of the RAKwireless WisBlock Series. It can be used for an accurate contactless thermal measurement for applications such as General purpose industry, temperature control of moving and hard to reach parts, body temperature measurement, non-contact thermometer for mobile and IoT application, with digital I2C/SPI serial interface standard output. 

#### Initial Test of the RAK12003 WisBlock Module

If you already installed the [RAKwireless Arduino BSP](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index), the WisBlock Core and example code should now be available on the Arduino IDE.

1. You need to select first the WisBlock Core you have, as shown in **Figure 6** and **Figure 7**.

2. The [Basic Sample Code for RAK12003](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/tree/master/examples/common/sensors/RAK12003_FIR_MLX90632) in Github will work on all WisBlock Core. You can open the the example codes depending on your WisBlock Core, as shown in **Figure 8** and **Figure 9**. 

**Sample code for RAK4631**

  caption="Opening RAK12003 example code for RAK11200 WisBlock Core"
/>

3. Once the example code is open, install the [SparkFun MLX90632](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_MLX90632_Arduino_Library) library by clicking the yellow highlighted link, as shown in **Figure 10** and **Figure 11**.

4. After successful installation of the library, you can now select the right serial port and upload the code, as shown in **Figure 12** and **Figure 13**.

/>

5. When you successfully uploaded the example sketch, open the Serial Monitor of the Arduino IDE to see the sensor's reading logs. If you see the logs, as shown in **Figure 14**, then your RAK12003 is properly communicating to the WisBlock core.
