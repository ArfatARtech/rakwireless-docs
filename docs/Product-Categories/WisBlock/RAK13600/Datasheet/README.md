# RAK13600 WisBlock NFC Reader Module Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

**RAK13600** is a **WisBlock Wireless** NFC reader module based on the PN532 chip. It provides a compact and low-power solution for NFC-related IoT applications. The RAK13600 has an integrated transceiver module used for NFC applications which operates at 13.56 MHz and is also based on the standard 80C51 microcontroller core. It supports 6 different operating
modes:


- ISO/IEC 14443A/MIFARE Reader/Writer
- FeliCa Reader/Writer
- ISO/IEC 14443B Reader/Writer
- ISO/IEC 14443A/MIFARE Card MIFARE Classic 1K or MIFARE Classic 4K card emulation mode
- FeliCa Card emulation
- ISO/IEC 18092, ECMA 340 Peer-to-Peer

### Hardware

The hardware specification is categorized into four parts. It discusses the pinouts of the module and its corresponding functions. It also covers the electrical and mechanical parameters that include the tabular data of its characteristics. This section also shows the schematic diagram of RAK13600.

#### Pin Definition

The RAK13600 WisBlock NFC Reader has the standard 40-pin WisConnector. It is compatible with the IO slot which allows the RAK13600 module to be mounted on a WisBlock baseboard, such as RAK5005-O. The pin order of the connector and the Pinout Definition is shown in **Figure 2**.
