# RAK14000 Quick Start Guide

## Prerequisite

### What Do You Need?

Before going through each and every step on using RAK14000 WisBlock E-Ink Display, make sure to prepare the necessary items listed below:

#### Hardware 


- [RAK14000 WisBlock E-Ink Display](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/wisblock-epd-module-rak14000)
- [WisBlock Base](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-base/)
- Your choice of [WisBlock Core](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-core)
- USB Cable
- [Li-Ion/LiPo battery (optional)](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-accessory/products/battery-connector-cable)
- [Solar charger (optional)](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-accessory/products/solar-panel-connector-cable)

#### Software 

##### Arduino

- Download and install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
- To add the RAKwireless Core boards on your Arduino Boards Manager, install the [RAKwireless Arduino BSP](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index).

## Product Configuration

### Hardware Setup

The RAK14000 module is part of the WisBlock Display category and connects to the baseboard through the IO slot. It has an E-Paper and three pushbutton interface that is connected via an FPC connector, as shown in Figure 1.

/>

#### Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules

##### Assembling

As shown in **Figure 2**, the location for the IO slot is properly marked by silkscreen. Follow carefully the procedure defined in [RAK5005-O module assembly/disassembly instructions](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK5005-O-Baseboard-Installation-Guide/) to attach a WisBlock module. Once attached, carefully fix the module with one or more pieces of M1.2 x 3&nbsp;mm screws depending on the module.

  caption="RAK14000 connection to WisBlock Base"
/>

##### Disassembling

The procedure in disassembling any type of WisBlock modules is the same. 

1. First, remove the screws.

  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak14000/quickstart/removing_screw.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Removing screws from the WisBlock module"
/>

2. Once the screws are removed, check the silkscreen of the module to find the correct location where force can be applied.

  width="70%"
  caption="Detaching silkscreen on the WisBlock module"

3. Apply force to the module at the position of the connector, as shown in **Figure 5**, to detach the module from the baseboard.

##### Connecting the E-Paper and Three Pushbutton Switch

::: tip üìù NOTE
Some illustrations are specific to the FPC connector of the Three Pushbutton Switch, but it is also applicable to the E-Paper.
:::

1. The FPC connectors for the E-Paper and Pushbutton are commonly set to close by default, as shown in **Figure 6**. 

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak14000/quickstart/rak14000-fpc-close.svg"
  width="50%"
  caption="RAK14000 FPC Connector Closed"
/>

2. You need to open the lock of the FPC connector by carefully pulling it up. Then insert fully and carefully the FPC cable of the E-Paper and the Three Pushbutton Switch with the copper trace facing down to the connector, as shown in **Figure 7**.

::: tip üìù NOTE
The E-Paper can be connected on either of the two FPC connectors. These are J2 and J3 in the RAK14000 board. This gives you flexibility on the orientation of the E-Paper display.
:::

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak14000/quickstart/rak14000-fpc-open.svg"
  width="70%"
  caption="RAK14000 FPC Connectors Open"
/>

3. Once done, make sure to lock the FPC connection again by carefully pushing down the lock until the FPC cable tightens, as shown in **Figure 8**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak14000/quickstart/rak14000-copper-bottom.svg"
  width="70%"
  caption="RAK14000 FPC Correct Connection"
/>

If the copper trace is on top, as shown in **Figure 9**, that is a **wrong connection**, and the E-Paper and Three Push button Switch will not work.

  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak14000/quickstart/rak14000-copper-top.png"
  width="50%"
  caption="RAK14000 FPC Wrong Connection"
/>

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you will connect other modules to remaining WisBlock Base slots, check on the [WisBlock Pin Mapper](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Pin-Mapper/) tool for possible conflicts.
:::

After all this setup, you can now connect the battery and USB cable to start programming your WisBlock Core.
