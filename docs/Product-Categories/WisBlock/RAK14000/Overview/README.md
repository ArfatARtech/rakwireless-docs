## Product Description

The **RAK14000 WisBlock E-Ink Display Module** is designed to be part of a production-ready IoT solution in a modular way and must be combined with a WisBlock Core and a WisBlock Base module.

The **RAK14000** module provides an interface to connect an E-Ink Display, which is known to be an extremely power-efficient display. The **E-Ink Display** is an Active Matrix Electrophoretic Display (AM EPD) module with 2.13&nbsp;inches active area (212 √ó 104 pixels for White Black Version and 250 x 122 pixels for the White-Black-Red Version). It also allows you to connect a Three-Button Module, which can be used on a different application. All of this can be controlled through a WisBlock Core.

## Prerequisites  

To use the **RAK14000 E-Ink Display Module**, you need a **WisBlock Base** to plug the module in. The WisBlock Base acts as a power supply for the RAK14000 WisBlock E-Ink module. Also, you need a **WisBlock Core** to control your module. 

After the successful mounting of **RAK14000** module to the IO Port of a WisBlock Base, you can now proceed to interface the E-Ink Display and Three-Button Module.  


:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING    
To be able to connect the E-Ink Display and Three-Button module, you must first unlock the slot connection on the RAK14000. You can do this by carefully pulling up the lock, then carefully insert the FPC (Flexible PCB) connector of the E-Ink Display and Three-Button module to the corresponding slots. Once done, make sure to lock the slot connection again by carefully pushing down until it tightens.
