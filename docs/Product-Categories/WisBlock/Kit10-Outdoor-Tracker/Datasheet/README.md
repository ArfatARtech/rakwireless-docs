# WisBlock Outdoor Location Tracker Kit Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

The **WisBlock Outdoor Location Tracker Kit** is a comprehensive and customizable IoT kit specifically designed to track the location of objects in outdoor environments. The kit includes two precise GPS/GNSS modules for tracking outdoor locations. Additionally, it has 9-DOF sensors and accelerometers, which aid in tracking object movements and direction changes.

With the WisBlock Outdoor Location Tracker Kit, you can monitor and track the location of a wide range of objects, including vehicles, equipment, and people. The kit provides real-time location data and allows users to analyze the data and create custom alerts and notifications based on specific events.

Multiple connectivity methods, including LoRaWAN, BLE, LTE-M, and NB-IoT, are supported by the WisBlock Outdoor Location Tracker Kit. This ensures that users can select the most appropriate communication channel based on their requirements and the available infrastructure. In addition, the kit is also highly customizable and can be configured to meet specific user needs.
