# RAK19009 WisBlock Mini Base Board with Power Slot Datasheet

## WisBlock Mini Base Board with Power Slot Overview

**RAK19009** is a **WisBlock Base** board that connects **WisBlock Core**, **WisBlock Power Module**, and **WisBlock Modules**. It has one slot reserved for the WisBlock Core module, one slot for the WisBlock Power module, and two Slot C-D for WisBlock Modules. The WisBlock Core and the Wisblock Power module are attached on the top side and the WisBlock Modules are attached to the bottom side of the RAK19009 WisBlock Base board. Slot C holds modules up to 23&nbsp;mm in size, while Slot D supports 10&nbsp;mm WisBlock Modules. Also, there are two **2.54&nbsp;mm pitch headers** for extension interface with **BOOT**, **I2C**, and **UART** pins.

WisBlock Modules are connected to the RAK19009 WisBlock Base board via **high-speed board to board connectors**. They provide secure and reliable interconnection to ensure the signal integrity of each data bus. A set of screws are used for fixing the modules, which makes it reliable even in an environment with lots of vibrations.

Using **RAK19009** as your WisBlock Base board, you can make your project compact, which is ideal in small enclosures. You can also use a [RAK19005 WisBlock Sensor Extension Cable](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/fpc-extension-cable-for-slot-a-to-d-rak19005) to position WisBlock Modules apart from the WisBlock Base board or in any part of your case.

#### Electrical Characteristics

##### Absolute Maximum Ratings

The **Absolute Maximum Ratings** of the device are shown in the table below. The stress ratings are the functional operation of the device. 

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏èWARNING
1. If the stress rating goes above what is listed, it may cause permanent damage to the device.
2. Under the listed conditions is not advised.
3. Exposure to maximum rating conditions may affect the device reliability.
:::

| **Ratings**         | Maximum Value   | Unit |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ---- |
| IOs of WisConnector | ‚Äì0.3 to VDD+0.3 | V    |
| ESD                 | 2000            | V    |

:::tip üìù NOTE
The RAK19009, like any electronic equipment, is sensitive to **electrostatic discharge (ESD)**. Improper handling can cause permanent damage to the module.

##### Current Consumption

The RAK19009 is designed for **low-power IoT products**. It has no power interface, so it must be used with a WisBlock Power module. When there is no module on RAK19009, the **leakage current is lower than 2&nbsp;¬µA**. With WisBlock Core and WisBlock sensor on it, the sleep current is **lower than 10&nbsp;¬µA**. When a LoRa module is transmitting, the current may reach **130&nbsp;mA**.

| **Conditions**                                                      | **Current** | **Unit** |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Leakage current, without any module on RAK19009                     | 2           | ¬µA       |
| Idle current, with WisBlock Core and WisBlock Modules in sleep mode | 10          | ¬µA       |
| Working current, with LoRa module transmitting                      | 130         | ¬µA       |
| Maximum output current                                              | 750         | mA       |
