## Product Description

**RAK19009** is a **WisBlock Base** board that connects **WisBlock Core**, **WisBlock Power Module**, and **WisBlock Modules**. It has one slot reserved for the WisBlock Core module, one slot for the WisBlock Power module, and two Slot C-D for WisBlock Modules. The WisBlock Core and the Wisblock Power module are attached on the top side and the WisBlock Modules are attached to the bottom side of the RAK19009 WisBlock Base board. Slot C holds modules up to 23&nbsp;mm in size, while Slot D supports 10&nbsp;mm WisBlock Modules. Also, there are two **2.54&nbsp;mm pitch headers** for extension interface with **BOOT**, **I2C**, and **UART** pins.

WisBlock Modules are connected to the RAK19009 WisBlock Base board via **high-speed board to board connectors**. They provide secure and reliable interconnection to ensure the signal integrity of each data bus. A set of screws are used for fixing the modules, which makes it reliable even in an environment with lots of vibrations.

Using **RAK19009** as your WisBlock Base board, you can make your project compact, which is ideal in small enclosures. You can also use a [RAK19005 WisBlock Sensor Extension Cable](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/fpc-extension-cable-for-slot-a-to-d-rak19005) to position WisBlock Modules apart from the WisBlock Base board or in any part of your case. **RAK19009** has connectors for the following:

* 1 WisBlock Core module
* 1 WisBlock Power module
* 2 WisBlock Modules compatible with Slot C-D
* 2 Headers with BOOT, I2C, and UART pins accessible with solder contacts

## Product Features

* Flexible building block design, which enables modular functionality and expansion
* High-speed interconnection connectors in the WisBlock Base board to ensure signal integrity
* Supports multiple types of low-power MCUs
* Supports multiple types of sensors - a single board can support a combination of two
  different types of sensors
* **Size:** A compact size of 30 x 37&nbsp;mm, which lets you create solutions that fit into smallest housings

## Prerequisites

To use a **RAK19009** WisBlock Mini Base Board with Power Slot, you need a **WisBlock Core**, **WisBlock Power Module**, and **WisBlock Modules** to start developing with the system.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

- RAK19009 requires a WisBlock Power Module to have power and connector interfaces. There is no USB and battery/power connector in RAK19009. These functionalities must be added by attaching the correct WisBlock Power Module for the application.
- Make sure to fix the modules with the screws to ensure a proper function.
