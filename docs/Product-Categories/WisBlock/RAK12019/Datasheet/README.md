# RAK12019 WisBlock UV Sensor Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

The RAK12019 is an Ambient Light sensor (ALS) or Ultraviolet Light Sensor (UVS), which is part of the RAKwireless WisBlock sensor series. The measured ambient light intensity and ultraviolet index are interfaced via the I2C bus making it immune to electrical noises, unlike its analog output counterpart. This module utilizes the LTR-390UV-01 sensor from Lite-On.


### Features

 - Ambient Light Sensor (ALS) or Ultraviolet Light Sensor (UVS)
 - I2C interface capable of Standard mode @100&nbsp;kHz or Fast mode @400kHz communication 1.8&nbsp;V logic compatible
 - Very low power consumption with sleep mode capability
 - 13 to 20 bits effective resolution
 - Wide dynamic range of 1:18,000,000 with linear response
 - Close to human eye spectral response
 - Automatic rejection for 50&nbsp;Hz/60&nbsp;Hz lighting flicker
 - Operating voltage ranges: 1.7&nbsp;V to 3.6&nbsp;V
 - Operating temperature ranges: -40 to +85&nbsp;¬∫C
 - Built-in temperature compensation circuit
 - Programmable interrupt function for ALS, UVS with upper and lower thresholds
 - RoHS and Halogen-free compliant 
 - Module Size: 10&nbsp;mm x 10&nbsp;mm

## Specifications

### Overview 

#### Mounting
