### Description

RAK12016 is a flex sensor module, a part of the RAKWireless WisBlock Sensor series. It uses an FS-L-0095-103-ST from Spectrasymbol, which can measure the amount of deflection or bending.

### Features

- Measure bending between 1 to 180 degrees
- Accuracy to 1 degree
- 3.3&nbsp;V Power Supply
- Module size: 15 X 25&nbsp;mm

## Specifications

### Overview

#### Mounting

The RAK12016 module can be mounted on the IO slot of the WisBlock Base board. **Figure 2** shows the mounting mechanism of the RAK12016 on a WisBlock Base module, such as the RAK5005-O.

::: tip üìù NOTE
- By using a JST PH2.54 Connector (J2), the flex sensor (FS-L-0095-103-ST) can also be an external module that is outside of the WisBlock unit, so it can measure bending on all kinds of objects.

### Hardware

The hardware specification is categorized into four parts. It discusses the pinouts and their corresponding functions and diagrams of the module. It also covers the electrical and mechanical characteristics that include the tabular data of the functionalities and standard values of the RAK12016 WisBlock Module.

#### Pin Definition

The RAK12016 module has a 40-pin WisConnector that is compatible to the WisBlock Base IO Slot. The pin order of the connector and the pinout definition is shown in **Figure 3**.

::: tip üìù NOTE
- Only **I2C** related pins, **3V3_S**, **GND**, and **ALERT** are connected to the WisConnector.
- **3V3_S** voltage output from the WisBlock Base that powers the RAK12016 module can be controlled by the WisBlock Core via WB_IO2 (WisBlock IO2 pin). This makes the module ideal for low-power IoT projects since the WisBlock Core can totally disconnect the power of the RAK12016 module.

##### Analog Input

**J2** is used to connect the flex sensor. The sensor acts like a variable resistor, the resistance changes due to the angle of bend by flexing the component. **R10** and the flex sensor constitute a series voltage divider. The MCP606 Comparator is used because the low input bias current of the Op Amp reduces the error due to the source impedance of the flex sensor as a voltage divider.

##### Analog to Digital Converter (ADC)

ADC121C021 is the ADC module used that features an I2C compatible serial interface. The **ALERT** feature provides a converting interrupt (Watchdog) function to ensure that the input voltage remains within the limits that are set in the Registers.
