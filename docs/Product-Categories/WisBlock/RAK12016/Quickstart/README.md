# RAK12016 Quick Start Guide

<!--
## Introduction

This guide introduces the RAK12016 WisBlock Flex Sensor Module and how to program with it.


-->

## Prerequisite

### What Do You Need?

Before going through each and every step on using the RAK12016 WisBlock module, make sure to prepare the necessary items listed below:

#### Hardware

- [RAK12016 WisBlock Flex Sensor Module](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak12016-wisblock-flex-sensor)
- Your choice of [WisBlock Base](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-base) with IO slot
- Your choice of [WisBlock Core](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-core)
- USB Cable
- [Li-Ion/LiPo battery (optional)](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-accessory/products/battery-connector-cable)
- [Solar charger (optional)](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-accessory/products/solar-panel-connector-cable)

#### Software

- Download and install the [ArduinoIDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
- To add the RAKwireless Core boards on your Arduino board, install the RAKwireless Arduino BSP. Follow the steps in the [Github repo](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index).

## Product Configuration

### Hardware Setup

RAK12016 is a flex sensor module, a part of the RAKwireless WisBlock Sensor series. It uses an FS-L-0095-103-ST from Spectrasymbol, which can measure the amount of deflection or bending.

For more information about RAK12016, refer to the [Datasheet](../Datasheet/).

RAK12016 module can be connected to the IO slot of [WisBlock Base](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/#wisblock-base) to communicate with the WisBlock Core, as shown in **Figure 1**. Also, always secure the connection of the WisBlock module by using compatible screws.

### Flex Sensor

A flex sensor uses carbon on a strip of plastic, which acts as a variable resistor. The more it bends, the higher the resistance of the sensor increases.

  width="50%"
  caption="FS-L-0095-103-ST Flex Sensor"
/>

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING    
The Flex sensor can only be bent in one direction. Thus, bending the sensor in the other direction may not produce any reliable data and may damage the sensor. Also, be careful not to bend the flex sensor near the bottom where the wires are attached in the RAK12016 module, as they have the potential to kink and fail.
:::  



#### Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules

##### Assembling

As shown in **Figure 3**, the location for the IO slot is properly marked by silkscreen. Follow carefully the procedure defined in [WisBlock Base board assembly/disassembly instructions](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK5005-O-Baseboard-Installation-Guide/) to attach a WisBlock module. Once attached, carefully fix the module with three pieces of M1.2 x 3&nbsp;mm screws.

  width="60%"
  caption="RAK12016 mounting connection to WisBlock Base module"
/>

##### Disassembling

The procedure in disassembling any type of WisBlock modules is the same. 

1. First, remove the screws.  

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak12016/quickstart/removing_screw.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Removing screws from the WisBlock module"
/>

2. Once the screws are removed, check the silkscreen of the module to find the correct location where force can be applied.

3. Apply force to the module at the position of the connector, as shown in **Figure 6**, to detach the module from the base board.

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you will connect other modules to the remaining WisBlock Base slots, check on the [WisBlock Pin Mapper](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Pin-Mapper/) tool for possible conflicts. 
:::

After all this setup, you can now connect the battery (optional) and USB cable to start programming your WisBlock Core.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
- Batteries can cause harm if not handled properly.
- Only 3.7-4.2&nbsp;V Rechargeable LiPo batteries are supported. It is highly recommended not to use other types of batteries with the system unless you know what you are doing.
- If a non-rechargeable battery is used, it has to be unplugged first before connecting the USB cable to the USB port of the board to configure the device. Not doing so might damage the battery or cause a fire.
- Only 5&nbsp;V solar panels are supported. Do not use 12&nbsp;V solar panels. It will destroy the charging unit and eventually other electronic parts.
- Make sure the battery wires match the polarity on the WisBlock Base board. Not all batteries have the same wiring.

### Software Configuration and Example

#### Initial Test of the RAK12016 WisBlock Module

1. Install the [RAKwireless Arduino BSP's for WisBlock](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index) by using the `package_rakwireless_index.json` board installation package, the WisBlock Core should now be available on the Arduino IDE.

2. You need to select first the WisBlock Core you have.

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you experience any error in compiling the example sketch, check the updated code for your WisBlock Core Module that can be found on the [RAK12016 WisBlock Example Code Repository](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/tree/master/examples/common/IO/RAK12016_Flex_FSL0095103ST). This sample code in Github will work on all WisBlock Core.
:::

4. Once the example code is open, install the [RAKWireless MQx](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAK-MQx-Library) library by clicking the yellow highlighted link, as shown in **Figure 10** and **Figure 11**.

5. After successful installation of the library, you can now select the right serial port and upload the code, as shown in **Figure 12** and **Figure 13**.

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you are using the RAK11200 as your WisBlock Core, the RAK11200 requires the **Boot0** pin to be configured properly first before uploading. If not done properly, uploading the source code to RAK11200 will fail. Check the full details on the [RAK11200 Quick Start Guide](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK11200/Quickstart/#uploading-to-wisblock).

6. When you successfully uploaded the example sketch, open the Serial Monitor of the Arduino IDE to see the sensor's reading logs, as shown in **Figure 14**. Try to bend the flex sensor, and you will see that the resistance readings increase, as well as the bent degrees. Therefore, your RAK12016 is properly communicating to the WisBlock core.
