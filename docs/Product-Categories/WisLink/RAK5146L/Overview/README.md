# RAK5146L WisLink LPWAN Concentrator

## Product Description

RAK5146L is an LPWAN Concentrator Module with a mPCIe form factor based on Semtech SX1303 and SX126X for Listen Before Talk feature, which enables easy integration into an existing router or other network equipment with LPWAN gateway capabilities. It can be used in any embedded platform offering a free mPCIe slot with SPI/USB connection. Furthermore, ZOE- M8Q GPS chip is integrated onboard.

This module is an exceptional, complete, and cost-efficient gateway solution offering up to 10 programmable parallel demodulation paths, 8 x 8 channel LoRa packet detectors, 8 x SF5-SF12 LoRa demodulators, and 8 x SF5-SF10 LoRa demodulators. It is capable of detecting an uninterrupted combination of packets at 8 different spreading factors and 10 channels with continuous demodulation of up to 16 packets. This product is best for smart metering fixed networks and Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications.
