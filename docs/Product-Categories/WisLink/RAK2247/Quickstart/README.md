## Product Configuration

### RAK2247 + x86 Linux PC
This section explains the basic steps on how to interface the RAK2247 WisLink LPWAN Concentrator with a Linux Operating System in a computer.

<!-- * The following devices are necessary for the interface:
  * RAK2247 WisLink LPWAN Concentrator
  * [mPCIe to USB Board](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/mpcie-to-usb-board) -->

1. Insert the RAK2247 mPCIe board into the USB carrier board and plugged into a free USB port of your PC. Your Linux PC should recognized it as a USB device.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
 If you want to connect the **RAK2247 mPCIe board** to the **Linux PC** directly, make sure to have the PERST# signal (Pin 22) pulled down.
:::

2. Open the command line then enter the command below in order to clone the Github repository that is required for the process to be completed:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/RAKWireless/rak_common_for_gateway.git
```

3. Get the name of the interface you are using to connect to the internet by typing the command:

```sh
ifconfig
```

An example in Figure 2 shows the name of the wireless interface ‚Äú**wlx6045bdf0cf64**‚Äù.

/>

* Enter the RAK Folder through:

```sh
cd rak_common_for_gateway/lora/rak2247_usb
```

4. Next, you need to insert the name you got in Step 3 for your interface in the following files:
    * rak_common_for_gateway/lora/set_eui.sh
    * rak_common_for_gateway/lora/update_gwid.sh
* Then, replace the following line:

```
GATEWAY_EUI_NIC=‚Äùeth0‚Äù
```

* With the line,

```
GATEWAY_EUI_NIC=‚Äùwlx6045bdf0cf64h0‚Äù
```

Again, the values are just an example. Remember to do this for all 3 files in step 4.


5. Change the `global_conf.json` that will be copied during installation by replacing the `global_conf.eu_863_870.json` in the end of the (install.sh file)[https://github.com/RAKWireless/rak_common_for_gateway/blob/master/lora/rak2247_usb/install.sh] to one of those inside `/global_conf` or a custom one. (**EU868 is the default**)
```sh
cp global_conf/global_conf.eu_863_870.json $INSTALL_DIR/packet_forwarder/lora_pkt_fwd/global_conf.json
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:
 You may also comment on the line below so the TTN address doesn't get replaced by localhost.
:::
```sh
# sed -i "s/^.*server_address.*$/\t\"server_address\": \"127.0.0.1\",/" $INSTALL_DIR/packet_forwarder/lora_pkt_fwd/global_conf.json
```

6. If you are using the RAK2247 in a board that has a different pinout than the RAK2247 Pi Hat, replace the `SX1301_RESET_BCM_PIN` in the `rak_common_for_gateway/lora/start.sh` to the corresponding RESET pin.
```sh
# Reset iC880a PIN
SX1301_RESET_BCM_PIN=<YOUR_RESET_PIN_HERE>
```
:::tip üìù NOTE:
 If you want to have your Gateway_ID automatically update when running your package forwarder, uncomment and change the line `#./update_gwid.sh ./local_conf.json` in the same file (start.sh) to `./update_gwid.sh ./global_conf.json`.
:::

7. **Add** the following lines of code at the end of ‚Äú**install.sh**‚Äù file: ( In addition to inserting the name of the interface from the previous step)

```sh
cp ../set_eui.sh packet_forwarder/lora_pkt_fwd/
cp ../update_gwid.sh packet_forwarder/lora_pkt_fwd/
cp ../start.sh packet_forwarder/lora_pkt_fwd/
mkdir -p /opt/ttn-gateway/
cp -rf packet_forwarder /opt/ttn-gateway/
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:
 If you want packet forwarder to start on boot, you need to also add the lines below:
:::

```sh
cp ../ttn-gateway.service /lib/systemd/system/
systemctl enable ttn-gateway.service
```


8. Save ‚Äú**install.sh**‚Äù file and execute it in order to install: 

```sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

9. Wait for the installation to complete. Using the commands below, go and run the newly created process (**lora_pkt_fwd**):

```sh
cd /opt/ttn-gateway/packet_forwarder/lora_pkt_fwd 
sudo ./lora_pkt_fwd
```
:::tip üìù NOTE:
 If you added the additional lines in step 5 it will execute every time on boot.
:::

10. To check if it is working, run `sudo systemctl start ttn-gateway.service` to start the service and check its status `service ttn-gateway status`. You should see something like the box below. Be aware that it may take some minutes to see your gateway as connected in TTN's console.
```sh
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ service ttn-gateway status

**Congratulations!** :tada: you should now see your Gateway in TTN!
