### Power on the Gateway

1. Attach the LoRa Antenna

First and foremost, screw on the antenna to the SMA connector back panel of the RAK7258 WisGate Edge Lite

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
 Do not power the device if the LoRa Antenna port has been left open to avoid potential damage in the RAK7258 WisGate Edge Lite.
:::

2. **Power** the Gateway **ON**

It is recommended to use the **12V DC adapter** that comes with the RAK7258 WisGate Edge Lite. Optionally, you can use your own **PoE cable** and **injector** since the device supports PoE.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
 Do not power the device if the LoRa Antenna port has been left open to avoid potential damage in the RAK7258 WisGate Edge Lite."
:::

#### Wi-Fi AP Mode

By default, the Gateway will work in Wi-Fi AP Mode which means that you can find an SSID named like "**RAK7258_XXXX**" on your PC's Wi-Fi Network List. "**XXXX**" is the last two bytes of the Gateway MAC address.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
 No password is required to connect via Wi-Fi
:::

* Using your preferred Web browser, login the credentials provided below:
    * **Browser Address**: `192.168.230.1`
    * **Username**: root

#### WAN Port DHCP IP

When DHCP Server is in the network where the gateway WAN interface is located, the WAN interface can automatically get the IP address. After inquiring the IP address of the gateway through DHCP Server, the WEB management platform of the gateway can be accessed through the DHCP IP address of WAN interface. Same as with the Wi-Fi AP mode, the same IP Address: `192.168.230.1` shall be used to access the **Web Management Platform**.


### Access the Internet

#### Connect through Wi-Fi

Go into the **Network>Wi-Fi Menu** and make sure to enable the **Wireless Client** as it is disabled initially. Enter or click "**Scan**" to choose your **ESSSID**, select the right **Encryption** method and enter the correct **Key**.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
 Assuming you have entered the correct parameter values you should get an IP address assigned by your Wi-Fi router's (AP) built-in DHCP server. You can use this new IP address to log in via a web browser (same way as in AP mode).
:::

#### Connect through Ethernet/PoE

Connect the **Ethernet Port (ETH)** of the RAK7258 WisGate Edge Lite via an Ethernet cable to your **Router**. The router‚Äôs DHCP server should assign an IP Address to the Gateway. You can change the default settings below if you wish (details in the User Manual).
