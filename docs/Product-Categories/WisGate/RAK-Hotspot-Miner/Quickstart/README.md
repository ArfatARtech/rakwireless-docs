### Power on the RAK Hotspot Miner

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
Before powering on, it is best advice to follow the guidelines below to avoid damaging the RAK Hotspot Miner. Familiarize the interfaces of the product as shown in the  [Interfaces](/Product-Categories/WisGate/RAK-Hotspot-Miner/Datasheet/#interfaces) section of the RAK Hotspot Miner Datasheet.
:::

1. Attach the LoRa Antenna.  

2. When you are ready to setup your RAK Hotspot Miner, plug in and connect the included power supply to the USB-C port on the RAK Hotspot Miner. After 30 seconds, the device should be ready to configure via the app.

:::tip üìù NOTE
From powering up the device, you only have 5 minutes to complete the setup. After 5 minutes, the app will no longer pair with the RAK Hotspot Miner. In that case, you need to turn it off and turn it back on to try again.

### Backup your microSD Card

Backing up your microSD Card is very important as this contains your RAK Hotspot Miner identity. If the card is lost or damaged, you may lose access to the Helium network, and require payment of a new add gateway fee. **Keep this backup card in a safe place**. 

You should only backup after adding the hotspot to your Helium account, and ideally once it has fully synced.

To backup, power off the RAK Hotspot Miner and follow [backup instructions](../Backup/).
