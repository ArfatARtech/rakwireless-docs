## ChirpStack

This guide will show you how to connect the RAKWireless Commercial V2 gateway running WisGateOS 2 to a ChirpStack Network server, whether it is installed in the local or external network.

The guide is not about how to install the ChirpStack, but how to configure the gateway to send data to it.

### Configuring the Edge Gateway V2 to ChirpStack

As mentioned before, the guide is for all RAK Edge V2 Series gateways running WisGateOS 2. It will be separated into two main sections based on where the ChirpStack Network server is installed:

- Local ChirpStack
- External ChirpStack

Different methods on how to connect the gateway to the server will be shown.

#### Local ChirpStack

In this case, the ChirpStack is installed in the local network. Three options will be considered here:

- **Connecting the Gateway via Packet Forwarder**
- **Connecting the Gateway via MQTT Bridge**
- **Connecting the Gateway via Basics Station**

Each option is explained in a separate section.

##### Connecting the Gateway via Packet Forwarder

In this method, you will configure the gateway‚Äôs packet forwarder to send data to the ChirpStack Gateway Bridge.

1. Start by accessing the gateway. To see how to access the gateway, refer to the [**Access the Gateway**](/Product-Categories/WisGate/RAK7268-V2/Quickstart/#access-the-gateway) section.


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7268-v2/supported-lora-network-servers/chirpstack/1.login-page.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Login page"
/>


2. Login using the set credentials you have set in the [**Access the Gateway**](/Product-Categories/WisGate/RAK7268-V2/Quickstart/#access-the-gateway) section.

3. On the left side, head to **LoRa¬Æ**. By default, the gateway is configured to work as a Built-in network server.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7268-v2/supported-lora-network-servers/chirpstack/2.network-server.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Network server settings"
/>


4. From **Work Mode**, select **Packet forwarder**. Click **Choose from the available protocols** to expand the Packet forwarder settings.


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7268-v2/supported-lora-network-servers/chirpstack/3.packet-forwarder.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Setting Packet Forwarder Mode"
/>


4. By default, when Packet Forwarder mode is chosen, the **Semtech UDP GWMP Protocol** is selected.

5. To point the gateway to the ChirpStack network using the packet forwarder, you only need to set the **Server address** of the ChirpStack.

In this case, the ChirpStack is installed locally on an Ubuntu machine on IP `192.168.0.130` (yours will be different). The other fields are filled with default parameters and can be left by default.


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7268-v2/supported-lora-network-servers/chirpstack/4.packet-forwarder.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Configuring Packet Forwarder to ChirpStack"
/>


6. Click **Save changes** to save the changes.

Now you need to register the gateway in ChirpStack. The steps are the same for all options.

#### Registering the Gateway in ChirpStack Network Server

1. To register the gateway in the ChirpStack Network server, access the ChirpStack UI. To do that, open a web browser and type the server address of the ChirpStack with port 8080.

```
<IP address of ChirpStack>:8080
```

In this case, the ChirpStack is installed on a local Ubuntu machine with IP `192.168.0.130`. The server address will be `192.168.0.130:8080`.


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7268-v2/supported-lora-network-servers/chirpstack/5.login.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="ChirpStack Login page"
/>


2. Login using the following credentials:

- Username/email: **admin**
- Password: **admin**


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7268-v2/supported-lora-network-servers/chirpstack/6.dashboard.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="ChirpStack dashboard"
/>


3. Head to **Gateways**, on the left pane.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7268-v2/supported-lora-network-servers/chirpstack/7.list.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Gateway list"
/>


4. By default, no gateways are registered. To register one, click **+ Create**.

5. In the **General menu**, you need to set the gateway parameters.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7268-v2/supported-lora-network-servers/chirpstack/8.register.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Register the gateway"
/>


- **Gateway name** ‚Äì unique name for the gateway on the Network server. The name may only contain words, numbers, and dashes.
- **Gateway description** ‚Äì a brief description of the gateway.
- **Gateway ID** ‚Äì the Extended Unique Identifier (EUI) of the gateway. The EUI can be found, on the Overview page of the Dashboard menu of the web UI of the gateway.
- **Network-server** - the network server to which the gateway will connect. When no network servers are available in the dropdown, make sure a service profile exists for this organization.
- **Service profile** - the service profile under which the gateway must be added. The available service profiles depend on the selected network server, which must be selected first.
- **Gateway profile** ‚Äì this field is optional. When assigning a gateway profile to the gateway, ChirpStack Network Server will attempt to update the gateway according to the gateway profile. Note that this does require a gateway with ChirpStack Concentratord.
- **Gateway discovery enabled** - When enabled (and ChirpStack Network Server is configured with the gateway discover feature enabled), the gateway will send out periodical pings to test its coverage by other gateways in the same network.
- **Gateway attitude** - When the gateway has an onboard GPS, this value will be set automatically when the network has received statistics from the gateway.
- **Gateway location** ‚Äì you can drag the marker to the location of the gateway. When the gateway has an onboard GPS, this value will be set automatically when the network receives statistics from the gateway.



6. Once, everything is set, click **Create gateway** to register the gateway. You will see the registered gateway in the **Gateway list**.

##### Connect the Gateway via MQTT Bridge

In this method, you will configure the gateway‚Äôs built-in gateway bridge to send data to the ChirpStack Broker.

1. Start by accessing the gateway. To access the gateway check the Access the gateway.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7268-v2/supported-lora-network-servers/chirpstack/12.login.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Login page"
/>


2. Login using the set credentials you have set in the **Access the gateway**.
3. On the left side, head to **LoRa¬Æ**. By default, the gateway is configured to work as a **Built-in network server**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7268-v2/supported-lora-network-servers/chirpstack/13.network-server.png"
  width="100%"

  width="100%"
  caption="Setting Packet Forwarder Mode"
/>


5. By default, when Packet Forwarder mode is chosen, the **Semtech UDP GWMP Protocol** is selected. To use the built-in gateway bridge, from the **Protocol** select **LoRa Gateway MQTT Bridge**.


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7268-v2/supported-lora-network-servers/chirpstack/15.mqtt-bridge.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="LoRa Gateway MQTT Bridge"
/>


The latest ChirpStack version supports both **MQTT for ChirpStack 3.x (JSON)** and **MQTT for ChirpStack 3.x (PROTOBUF).**

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you want to use JSON protocol, you need to change the payload marshaler in the gateway bridge .toml file to ‚ÄúJSON‚Äù.
:::


To configure the payload marshaler you need to access the configuration file of the gateway bridge. You can access it with the configuration file of the gateway bridge. You can also access it with an SSH connection. In this case, you will use the SSH client PuTTY to access the configuration files.

6. Access the ChirpStack via PuTTY. You need to type the address of the ChirpStack server in the **Host name** field and click **Open**. In this case on IP 192.168.0.130.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7268-v2/supported-lora-network-servers/chirpstack/16.access-chirpstack.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="PuTTY client"
/>


7. In the `/etc/chirpstack-gateway-bridge/chirpstack-gateway-bridge.toml`, find the **Integration** section and change the marshaler to JSON.


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7268-v2/supported-lora-network-servers/chirpstack/17.payload-marshaler.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Payload Marshaler"
/>

8. Save and exit the file.

9. However, if you are using an earlier version of ChirpStack (V2), you will need to select **MQTT for ChirpStack 2. x**. The option **MQTT for Embedded RAK Network Server** is for a mesh network, where one gateway plays the role of a network server.

For this example, you will choose **MQTT for ChirpStack 3. x (PROTOBUF).**

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7268-v2/supported-lora-network-servers/chirpstack/18.mqtt.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="MQTT for Chirpstack Protocol"
/>


10. By default, the built-in gateway bridge is pointed to the local Broker (127.0.0.1). To point the gateway to the ChirpStack network, you need to set the ChirpStack Broker address in the **MQTT Broker Address** field.

In this case, the ChirpStack is installed locally on an Ubuntu machine on IP 192.168.0.130 (yours will be different). The default port that the MQTT Broker uses is 1883.


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7268-v2/supported-lora-network-servers/chirpstack/19.packet-forwarder.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Configuring Packet Forwarder to ChirpStack"
/>


11.  Click **Save changes** to save the changes.

12.  Now you need to register the gateway in the ChirpStack Network server. When Packet Forwarder mode is chosen, the **Semtech UDP GWMP Protocol** is selected by default. To register the gateway in ChirpStack, see **Registering gateway in ChirpStack Network server** section.

13.  If everything is set correctly, the **Last seen** status will state **a few seconds ago**.


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7268-v2/supported-lora-network-servers/chirpstack/20.registered-gateway.png"
  width="100%"

  caption="Gateway details"
/>


Now your gateway is connected to the ChirpStack Network server.

##### Connecting the Gateway via Basics Station

1. In this method, you will connect the gateway to the **ChirpStack** via **Basics Station**. The **LoRa Basics‚Ñ¢ Station** is an implementation of a LoRa packet forwarder.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7268-v2/supported-lora-network-servers/chirpstack/22.login-page.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Login page"
/>


2. Login using the set credentials you have set in the **Access the gateway**.
3. n the left side, head to LoRa. By default, the gateway is configured to work as a Built-in network server.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7268-v2/supported-lora-network-servers/chirpstack/23.network.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Network Server Settings"
/>


4. For **Work Mode**, select **Basics station** and click **Configure Basics Station** server setup to expand the Basics Station settings.


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7268-v2/supported-lora-network-servers/chirpstack/24.basic-station.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Setting Basics Station mode"
/>


Here you need to point the gateway to the ChirpStack Network server:

- **Server** ‚Äì For server, choose LNS Server.
- **URI** ‚Äì the address of the ChirpStack server. In this case, the ChirpStack is installed locally on an Ubuntu machine on IP 192.168.0.130 (yours will be different). The URI will be `ws://192.168.0.130`.

::: tip üìù NOTE
The URL starts with ws:// in case a plain text connection is used. Using the wss:// scheme will trigger a TLS connection based on the `tc.{cert,key,trust}` credentials set.
:::

- **Port** ‚Äì the port to which the Websocket listens. The port is 3001.
- **Authentication Mode** ‚Äì authentication for the ChirpStack server. For this case, you will use no authentication.


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7268-v2/supported-lora-network-servers/chirpstack/25.basics-station.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Configuring Basics Station to ChirpStack"
/>


5. Click **Save changes** to save the changes.

Now your gateway is configured to work as Basics Station, and it is pointed to the ChirpStack gateway bridge. The default installation of the ChirpStack setups the backend configuration of the ChirpStack gateway bridge to `semtech_udp`.

6. To configure the backend of the ChirpStack gateway bridge, you need to access the configuration file of the bridge. To access it, you will need an SSH terminal. In this case, you will use a PuTTY client.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7268-v2/supported-lora-network-servers/chirpstack/26.access.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="PuTTY client"
/>


Copy the configuration file's text in the [ChirpStack Gateway bridge webpage](https://www.chirpstack.io/gateway-bridge/install/config/) and place it in `/etc/chirpstack-gateway-bridge/chirpstack-gateway-bridge.toml`.

7. In the file, find the **Gateway backend configuration** paragraph and replace the type with `basic_station.`


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7268-v2/supported-lora-network-servers/chirpstack/27.bridge-type.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Configure gateway bridge type"
/>


8. Now scroll down until you find the **Concentrator configuration** paragraph and uncomment the following text as shown below. Uncommenting the text, enables the configuration for the SX1301 concentrator chips.


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7268-v2/supported-lora-network-servers/chirpstack/28.bridge-backend.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Configure gateway bridge backend"
/>



9. Save and exit the `.toml` file and restart the gateway bridge service to apply the changes by restarting the gateway bridge service with the following command:

```
sudo systemctl restart chirpstack-gateway-bridge.service
```

Now the ChirpStack backend configuration is set to basics station.

10. Then, you need to register the gateway in the ChirpStack Network server. To register the gateway in ChirpStack, see **Registering gateway in ChirpStack Network server** section.

If everything is set correctly, the **Last seen** status will state a few seconds ago. You can click the gateway name to inspect the gateway traffic.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7268-v2/supported-lora-network-servers/chirpstack/29.registered-gateway.png"

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7268-v2/supported-lora-network-servers/chirpstack/30.gateway-details.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Gateway details"
/>


Now your gateway is connected to the ChirpStack Network server.

#### External ChirpStack

In this case, the ChirpStack is installed on an external network. In the following example, the ChirpStack Network server is installed on the AWS cloud. A guide on how to install it on AWS can be found in the [Knowledge Hub](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/Amazon-Web-Services/#installing-chirpstack) section.

To access the ChirpStack web UI, you need to enable **TCP port 8080** and to make the gateway to communicate with the Network server you need to enable the following ports in the inbound rules of the instance:

- The Semtech Packet Forwarder needs UDP port 1700.
- MQTT Bridge (unsecured) needs TCP port 1883.
- MQTT Bridge (secured) needs TCP port 8883.
- Basics Station needs TCP port 3001.

:::tip üìù NOTE
A guide on how to open the above ports can be found in the [guide](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/Amazon-Web-Services/#installing-chirpstack) on how to install ChirpStack on AWS.
:::

Three options will be considered here:

- **Connecting the Gateway via Packet Forwarder**
- **Connecting the Gateway via MQTT Bridge**
- **Connecting the Gateway via Basics Station**

Each option is explained in its own separate section.

##### Connecting the Gateway via Packet Forwarder

In this method, you will configure the gateway‚Äôs packet forwarder to send data to the ChirpStack Gateway Bridge.

:::tip üìù NOTE
When connecting the gateway to the ChirpStack, you will need to open ports 1700 and 8080 to enable the communication between the gateway and the server and be able to access the ChirpStack.

5. Click **Save changes** to save the changes.

Now you need to register the gateway in the ChirpStack Network server.

##### Registering the Gateway in ChirpStack

The steps for registering the gateway in ChirpStack are the same for all options.

1. To register the gateway in the ChirpStack Network server, access the ChirpStack UI. To do that, open a web browser and type the server address of the ChirpStack with port 8080.

```
<IP address of ChirpStack>:8080
```

2. In this case, the ChirpStack is installed on the AWS cloud with the public IP address `18.156.176.220.`

  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7268-v2/supported-lora-network-servers/chirpstack/39.register.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Register the gateway"
/>

- **Gateway name** ‚Äì unique name for the gateway on the Network server. The name may only contain words, numbers, and dashes.
- **Gateway description** ‚Äì a brief description of the gateway.
- **Gateway ID** ‚Äì the Extended Unique Identifier (EUI) of the gateway. The EUI is in the Overview menu of the Dashboard page of the web UI of the gateway.
- **Network server** - the network server to which the gateway will connect. When no network servers are available in the dropdown, make sure a service profile exists for this organization.
- **Service-profile** - the service profile under which the gateway must be added. The available service profiles depend on the selected network server, which must be selected first.
- **Gateway profile** ‚Äì this field is optional. When assigning a gateway profile to the gateway, ChirpStack Network Server will attempt to update the gateway according to the gateway profile. Note that this does require a gateway with ChirpStack Concentrator.
- **Gateway discovery enabled** - When enabled (and ChirpStack Network Server is configured with the gateway discover feature enabled), the gateway will send out periodical pings to test its coverage by other gateways in the same network.
- **Gateway attitude** - When the gateway has an onboard, this value will be set automatically when the network has received statistics from the gateway.
- **Gateway location** ‚Äì you can drag the marker to the location of the gateway. When the gateway has an onboard GPS, this value will be set automatically when the network receives statistics from the gateway.


7. Once everything is set, click **Create gateway** to register the gateway. You will see the registered gateway in the Gateway list.

If everything is set correctly, the Last seen status in the ChirpStack will state **a few seconds ago.**

Now your gateway is connected to the ChirpStack Network server.

##### Connecting the Gateway via MQTT Bridge

In this method, you will configure the gateway‚Äôs built-in bridge to publish the data to the ChirpStack MQTT broker.

:::tip üìù NOTE
When connecting the gateway to the ChirpStack, you will need to open ports 1883 and 8080 to enable the communication between the gateway and the server and be able to access the ChirpStack.

5. By default, when Packet Forwarder mode is chosen, the **Semtech UDP GWMP Protocol** is selected. To use the built-in gateway bridge, from the **Protocol** select **LoRa Gateway MQTT Bridge**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7268-v2/supported-lora-network-servers/chirpstack/46.mqtt-bridge.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="LoRa Gateway MQTT bridge"
/>


The latest ChirpStack version supports both **MQTT for ChirpStack 3.x (JSON)** and **MQTT for ChirpStack 3.x (PROTOBUF).**

:::tip üìù NOTE
If you want to use JSON protocol, you need to change the payload marshaler in the gateway bridge `.toml` file to json. By default, the marshaler is protobuf.
:::

6. To configure the payload marshaler, you need to access the configuration file of the gateway bridge. You can access it with an SSH connection. In this case, you will use the SSH client PuTTY to access the configuration files. How to do this is explained in the [Knowledge Hub](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/Amazon-Web-Services/#accessing-instance-via-ssh) section.

  width="100%"
  caption="Payload Masher"
/>

8. Save and exit the file.

However, if you are using an earlier version of ChirpStack (V2), you will need to select **MQTT for ChirpStack 2.x.** The option **MQTT for Embedded RAK Network Server** is for a mesh network, where one gateway plays the role of a network server. For this example, you will choose **MQTT for ChirpStack 3.x (PROTOBUF)**.


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7268-v2/supported-lora-network-servers/chirpstack/49.chirpstack-protocol.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="MQTT for ChirpStack protocol"
/>


By default, the built-in gateway bridge is pointed to the local Broker (127.0.0.1). To point the gateway to the ChirpStack network, you need to set the ChirpStack Broker address in the **MQTT Broker Address** field.

In this case, the ChirpStack is installed on an AWS cloud instance with public IP `18.156.176.220` (yours will be different). The default port that the MQTT Broker uses is 1883.
