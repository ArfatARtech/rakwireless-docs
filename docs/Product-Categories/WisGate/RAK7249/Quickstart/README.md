#### Installation Guide

1. Install the bolts in the holes which are circled in red in the following image below. This will make an "**H-shaped**" base, for the Solar Panel to be mountable on the top. The circular pipe in the middle of the shape is meant to fit over a circular shaped pole, so the whole construction sits on top with the panel facing upwards on an angle.

:::tip üìù NOTE
 Tighten the nuts and make sure that the rails that make up the base are holding tight against each other.
:::

  width="40%"
  caption="H-Shaped Nuts and Bolts Placement for the Bracket"
/>

2. Mount the battery on top of the two parallel rails in the middle. Make sure it is as close as possible to the middle of the construction. Fasten it to the rails with four bolts, each having a washer and a nut. Refer to the image below on how to insert the bolts into the railing that is part of the bottom of the battery casing.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
Tighten the bolts as possible as the battery is quite heavy.

:::tip üìù NOTE
 Your battery life will vary depending on local illumination intensity. For a 50Ah battery and an 80W solar panel, such as the ones used in the kit, the RAK7249 - Macro Outdoor Gateway should function for about 4 days. This is the worst case scenario where there is constant heavy rain and or constant presence of clouds.
:::

:::tip üìù NOTE
 If you live in extreme condition environment that result in operational time significantly less than 4 days, reconsider into increasing the battery capacity and installing a solar panel with greater power output to compensate such issues.
:::

6. Mount the whole installation you have assembled on top of a circular pole. Put the panel facing up and insert the pole in the pipe opening on the bottom of the construction. Make sure the pole is of a sufficiently small diameter to fit with a recommended value of **65 millimeters**. Use **6 pieces of M8-bolts** to fix the bottom to the construction as shown in the image below.

### Lightning Protection

In this document, we will be discussing on how to setup your lightning surge protection system whether be your RAK7249 WisGate Edge Max situated outdoor or indoor. Such protection system must be taken into consideration to ensure a fully functional Gateway without interruption or damage from the lightings.

  width="80%"
  caption="Full Lighting Protection Set-up Diagram"
/>

#### Outdoor Surge Protection System

##### Antenna Grounding

RAKwireless recommends a lightning arrestor to be installed on all the antenna **N-Type
terminals** (**LoRa, LTE, Wi-Fi and GPS**). It is recommended to use a **10-AWG or better
grounding wire** to connect the arrestor to the tower mounted LoRa antenna. The arrestors
have to be Female to Male type in order to fit the antenna and housing connectors. Make
sure you use a 10 AWG or better wire to connect the screw terminals of the arrestors to
the grounding rail mounted on the building wall (grounding bar in case of field deployment
as in the picture).

##### Gateway Grounding

Additionally it is recommended to use another 10 AWG or better grounding wire to
connect the screw terminal on the bottom right side of the Gateway casing to the
grounding rail (bar).

:::tip üìù NOTE
No additional protection for the Ethernet cabling is required at the Gateway side. There is a surge protection system built-in (GDT + Anti-surge resistor).
:::

#### Indoor Surge Protection

For the purpose of protecting the indoor equipment and circuitry connected to the Gateway you need to install an **Ethernet port SPD lightning arrester**. It should be positioned along the cabling connecting the Gateway to the PoE injector. Make sure you connect its grounding wire terminal to an appropriate building grounding point. Thus your PoE injector and network switch/router should be surge protected. Please refer to the images in the diagram below for the Outdoor and Indoor portion of the surge protection system. Should you fail to adhere to the recommendations in this document RAKwireless carries no responsibility for any damage your equipment incurs due to lightning strike!

#### Recommended Equipment

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
Do not power the device if the LoRa Antenna port has been left open to avoid potential damage in the RAK7249 WisGate Edge Max."
:::

#### Wi-Fi AP Mode
By default, the Gateway will work in Wi-Fi AP Mode which means that you can find an SSID named like **"RAK7249_XXXX"** on your PC's Wi-Fi Network List. "XXXX" is the last two bytes of the Gateway MAC address. To access the Web Management Platform, input the IP Address: `192.168.230.1` in your Web browser.

:::tip üìù NOTE
No password is required to connect via Wi-Fi
:::

Using your preferred Web browser, input the aforementioned IP Address and you should see the same Log-in Page shown in the following image. Login the credentials provided below:

### WAN Port (Ethernet)

Connect the Ethernet cable to the port marked ‚ÄúETH‚Äù on the Gateway and the other end to the PoE port of the PoE injector. Connect the LAN port of the PoE injector to your PC.

The default IP is **169.254.X.X.** The last two segments(X.X) are mapped from the last four bits of the MAC address of your gateway. For example, the last four bits of the MAC address are 0F:01, and the IP address is 169.254.15.1. Make sure to manually set the address of your PC to one in the same network (for example 169.254.15.100). Use the same credentials for the Web UI as for AP mode.
