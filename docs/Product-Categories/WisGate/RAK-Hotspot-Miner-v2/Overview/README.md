## Product Background

**Hotspot Details**

- Efficient miner for a new cryptocurrency, **Helium (HNT)**
- Complete set-up in minutes using a smartphone
- **LongFi technology** maximizes range and battery life without Wi-Fi, cellular or Bluetooth
- Low Power â€“ only uses about the same amount as an LED light bulb (5W)
- Easily manage Hotspots and tokens from the mobile app
- LongFiâ„¢ Technology

![longfi](/assets/images/wisgate/rak-hotspot-miner/icons/longfi.png)

**Helium LongFi** is a technology architecture that combines a leading wireless technology, LoRaWAN, and the Helium Blockchain. LongFi is optimized for miles of range, and long battery life for IoT devices.

![proof-of-coverage](/assets/images/wisgate/rak-hotspot-miner/icons/proof-of-coverage.png)

RAK Hotspot Miners earn Helium when devices connect, and for validating wireless coverage delivered by peers. Using a system called Proof-of-Coverage, RAK Hotspot Miners earn more Helium when they are in range of other RAK Hotspot Miners, but need to be at least 300 meters apart.

Range depends on the environment. For rural areas, **up to 10 miles or more**, but for more dense areas, **up to a mile**. Single RAK Hotspot Miners earn less as they can only issue Challenges over the internet and cannot participate in Proof-of-Coverage.

- Deliver may square miles of coverage from a single RAK Hotspot Miner
- Based on initial testing, only about 50 to 100 RAK Hotspot Miners are needed to provide complete coverage for an entire city.

![connect-anything](/assets/images/wisgate/rak-hotspot-miner/icons/connect-anything.png)

- Create a new global network for billions of devices
- Any IoT device can become Helium-enabled using readily available off-the-shelf hardware components, software, and a reference design that is open source for anyone to improve upon.
