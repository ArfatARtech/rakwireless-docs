# RAK7248 Supported LoRa Network Servers


## AWS IoT Core

Execute the following steps to set up your AWS account and permissions:
### Set Up Your AWS Account and Permissions

If you don't have an AWS account, refer to the instructions in the guide here. The relevant sections are **Sign up for an AWS account**and **Create a user and grant permissions**.  

#### Overview 

The high-level steps to get started with AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN are as follows:

1. Set up Roles and Policies in IAM
2. Add a Gateway (see section Add the Gateway to AWS IoT)
3. Add Device(s) (see section Add a LoRaWAN Device to AWS IoT)
    - Verify device and service profiles
    - Set up a Destination to which device traffic will be routed and processed by a rule.  

These steps are discussed as you browse through this guide. For additional details, refer to the AWS LoRaWAN developer guide.

#### Set Up Roles and Policies in IAM


Adding an IAM role will allow the Configuration and Update Server (CUPS) to handle the wireless gateway credentials. 

This procedure needs to be done only once but must be performed before a LoRaWAN gateway tries to connect with AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN.

1. Go to the [IAM Roles](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/roles) page on the IAM console.
2. Choose **Create role**.
3. On the Create Role page, choose **Another AWS account**. 
4. Enter your **Account ID**, then select **Next: Permissions**.
5. In the search box next to the Filter Policies, type **_AWSIoTWirelessGatewayCertManager_**.
   - If the search results show the policy named **_AWSIoTWirelessGatewayCertManager_**, select it by clicking the checkbox.
   - If the policy does not exist, create one:
      - Go to the [IAM console](http://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).
      - Choose **Policies** from the navigation pane.
      - Choose **Create Policy**, then select the **JSON** tab to open the policy editor. 
      - Replace the existing template with trust policy document.
  
      ```json
      {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
      {
      "Sid": "IoTWirelessGatewayCertManager",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
      "iot:CreateKeysAndCertificate",
      "iot:DescribeCertificate",
      "iot:ListCertificates",
      "iot:RegisterCertificate"
               ],
      "Resource": "*"
                }
            ]
      }   
      ```

      - Choose **Review Policy** to open the Review Page.
      - For the Name, type _**AWSIoTWirelessGatewayCertManager**_.

   :::tip üìù NOTE:
   You must enter the name as **_AWSIoTWirelessGatewayCertManager_** and must not use a different name. This is for consistency with future releases.
   :::

     - For the **Description**, enter a description of your choice. 
     - Then choose **Create policy**. You will see a confirmation message showing the policy has been created.
  

6. Choose **Next: Tags**, then **Next: Review**.
7. In **Role name**, enter _**IoTWirelessGatewayCertManagerRole**_, and then choose to **Create role**.
   
:::tip üìù NOTE:
You must not use a different name.  This is for consistency with future releases.
:::

8. In the confirmation message, choose _**IoTWirelessGatewayCertManagerRole**_ to edit the new role.
9. In the **Summary**, choose the **Trust relationships** tab, and then choose **Edit trust relationship**.
10. In the **Policy Document**, change the **Principal** property to represent the IoT Wireless service:

    ```json
    "Principal": { 
    "Service": "iotwireless.amazonaws.com"  
    },
    ```

- After changing the Principal property, the complete policy document should look like the following:

    ```json
    {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
    "Service": "iotwireless.amazonaws.com"
            },
    "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
    "Condition": {}
        }
        ]
    }
    ```

11. Choose **Update Trust Policy** to save your changes and exit.
At this point, you have created the _**IoTWirelessGatewayCertManagerRole**_ and you won't need to do this again.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
The examples in this document are intended only for dev environments. All devices in your fleet must have credentials with privileges that authorize only intended actions on specific resources. The specific permission policies can vary for your use case. Identify the permission policies that best meet your business and security requirements.

    }
    ]
    }
    ```

5. Choose **Update Trust Policy.** Under Trusted entities, you will see: *The identity provider(s) iotwireless.amazonaws.com*.



#### Add the Gateway to AWS IoT

##### Requirements

To complete setting up your gateway, you need the following:

- **LoRaWAN region**. For example, if the gateway is deployed in a US region, the gateway must support LoRaWAN region US915.
- **Gateway LNS-protocols**. Currently, the LoRa Basics Station protocol is supported.
- **Gateway ID (GatewayEUI) or serial number**. This is used to establish the connection between the LNS and the gateway. Consult the documentation for your gateway to locate this value.
- Add minimum software versions required, including Basics Station 2.0.5.

##### Add the LoRaWAN Gateway

To register the Gateway with AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN, execute these steps:

1. Go to the [AWS IoT console](http://console.aws.amazon.com/iot). 
2. Select **Wireless connectivity** in the navigation panel on the left.
3. Choose **Intro**, and then select **Get started**. This step is needed to pre-populate the default profiles.
4. Under **Add LoRaWAN gateways and wireless devices**, choose **Add gateway**.
5. In the **Add gateway** section, fill in the **GatewayEUI** and **Frequency band (RF Region)** fields.
6. Enter a descriptive name in the **Name** ‚Äì optional field. It is recommended that you use the GatewayEUI as the name.
7. Choose **Add gateway**.
8. On the **Configure your Gateway** page, find the section titled **Gateway certificate**. 
9. Select **Create certificate**.
10. Once the **Certificate created and associated with your gateway** message is shown, select **Download certificates** to download the certificate (*xxxxx.cert.pem*) and private key (*xxxxxx.private.key*).
11. In the section **Provisioning credentials**, choose **Download server trust certificates** to download the **CUPS (cups.trust)** and **LNS (lns.trust)** server trust certificates.
12. Copy the CUPS and LNS endpoints and save them for use while configuring the gateway.
13. Choose **Submit** to add the gateway.


#### Add a LoRaWAN Device to AWS IoT

##### Requirements

- Locate and note the following specifications about your endpoint device.
    - **LoRaWAN Region**: This must match the gateway LoRaWAN region. The following Frequency bands (RF regions) are supported:
        o	EU868
        o	US915
        o	EU433
    - **MAC Version**: This must be one of the following:
        o	V1.0.2
        o	v1.0.3 
        o	v1.1
    - OTAA v1.0x and OTAA v1.1 are supported.
    - ABP v1.0x and ABP v1.1 are supported.

- Locate and note the following information from your device manufacturer: 
    - For **OTAA v1.0x devices**: DevEUI, AppKey, AppEUI
    - For **OTAA v1.1 devices**: DevEUI, AppKey, NwkKey, JoinEUI
    - For **ABP v1.0x devices**: DevEUI, DevAddr, NwkSkey, AppSkey
    - For **ABP v1.1 devices**: DevEUI, DevAddr, NwkSEnckey, FNwkSIntKey, SNwkSIntKey, AppSKey


##### Verify Profiles

AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN supports device profiles and service profiles. Device profiles contain the communication and protocol parameter values the device needs to communicate with the network server. Service profiles describe the communication parameters the device needs to communicate with the application server.

Some pre-defined profiles are available for device and service profiles. Before proceeding, verify that these profile settings match the devices you will be setting up to work with AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN.


1. Navigate to the [AWS IoT console](http://console.aws.amazon.com/iot).
2. In the navigation pane, choose **Wireless connectivity** then select **Profiles**.
3. In the **Device Profiles** section, there are some pre-defined profiles listed. Check each of the profiles to determine if one of them will work for you.
4. If not, select **Add device profile** and set up the parameters as needed. For US 915 as an example, the values are as follows:
      
      - MacVersion 1.0.3
      - RegParamsRevision RP002-1.0.1
      - MaxEirp 10
      - MaxDutyCycle 10
      - RfRegion US915
      - SupportsJoin true

5. Continue once you have a device profile that will work for you.
6. In the **Service Profiles** section, there are some pre-defined profiles listed. Check each of the profiles to determine if one of them will work for you.
7. If not, select **Add service profile** and set up the parameters as needed.  As an example, the default service profile parameters are shown below. However, only the _**AddGwMetadata**_ setting can be changed at this time.
     
      - UlRate 60
      - UlBucketSize 4096
      - DlRate 60
      - DlBucketSize 4096
      - AddGwMetadata true
      - DevStatusReqFreq 24
      - DrMax 15
      - TargetPer 5
      - MinGwDiversity 1

8. Proceed only if you have a device and service profile that will work for you.

##### Set Up a Destination for Device Traffic

Because most LoRaWAN devices don't send data to AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN in a format that can be consumed by AWS services, traffic must first be sent to a Destination.  A Destination represents the AWS IoT rule that processes a device's data for use by AWS services. This AWS IoT rule contains the SQL statement that selects the device's data and the topic rule actions that send the result of the SQL statement to the services that will use it.

For more information on Destinations, refer to the AWS [LoRaWAN Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/connect-iot-lorawan.html).

A destination consists of a **Rule** and a **Role**. To set up the destination, execute the following steps:

1. Navigate to the [AWS IoT console](http://console.aws.amazon.com/iot). 
2. In the navigation pane, choose **Wireless connectivity**, and then **Destinations**.
3. Choose **Add Destination**.
4. On the Add destination page, in the **Permissions** section, select the IAM role you had created earlier from the drop-down.
5. Under the **Destination details**, enter _**ProcessLoRa**_ as the Destination name, and an appropriate description under **Destination description ‚Äì optional**.


:::tip üìù NOTE:
The Destination name can be anything. For getting started and consistency, choose **ProcessLoRa** for the first integration with AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN.
:::

5. For **Rule name**, enter _**LoRaWANRouting**_. Ignore the section **Rules configuration ‚Äì Optional** for now.  The Rule will be set up later in the *"Hello World*" sample application. See Create the IoT Rule for the destination.
6. Choose **Add Destination**.  You will see a message "_Destination added_", indicating the destination has been successfully added.


##### Register the Device

Now, register an endpoint device with AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN as follows:

1. Go to the [AWS IoT console](http://console.aws.amazon.com/iot).
2. Select **Wireless connectivity** in the navigation panel on the left.
3. Select **Devices**, then choose **Add wireless device**.
4. On the **Add device** page, select the LoRaWAN specification version in the drop-down under **Wireless device specification**.
5. Under **LoRaWAN specification and wireless device configuration**, enter the **DevEUI** and confirm it in the **Confirm DevEUI** field.
6. Enter the remaining fields as per the OTAA/ABP choice you made above.
7. Enter a name for your device in the **Wireless device name ‚Äì optional field**.
8. In the **Profiles** section, under **Wireless device profile**, find a drop-down option that corresponds to your device and region. 

:::tip üìù NOTE:
Compare your device details to ensure the device profile is correct.  If there are no valid default options, you will have to create a new profile. See the Verify Profiles section.
:::

9. Choose **Next**.
10. Choose the destination you created earlier (_ProcessLoRa_) from the drop-down under **Choose destination**.
11. Choose **Add device**.
12. You will see a message saying "_Wireless device added_", indicating that your device has been set up successfully.

- [**Community Forum**](https://forum.rakwireless.com/?utm_source=Docs&utm_medium=Docsheader&utm_campaign=RAKDocs)

#### Configure the Gateway Device

1. To connect to the AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN, you need to download and compile **BasicsStation**.
Assuming that you have successfully accessed the gateway via SSH, it is a good policy to update/upgrade. Doing so, it will update all the packages:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

```bash
sudo apt upgrade
```

2. Now, register the gateway in AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN. To register your gateway, you will need the device‚Äôs EUI. To find the gateway‚Äôs EUI, run the command below to open the Graphics User Interface (GUI). The EUI can be found on the top of the GUI: 

```bash
sudo gateway-config
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7248/supported-lora-network-servers/aws/1.gateway-id.png"
  width="80%"
  caption="RAK7248 Configuration Options"
/>

You can also run the following command:

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7248/supported-lora-network-servers/aws/2.gateway-version.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Gateway Version"
/>

```bash
pi@rak-gateway:~ $ sudo gateway-version
Raspberry Pi 4 Model B Rev 1.1, OS "10 (buster)", 5.4.79-v7l+.
RAKwireless gateway RAK7248 no LTE version 4.2.7R install from firmware
Gateway ID: DCA632FFFE366417
```

3. Only the configuration of the Basics station remains. Clone the Basics station repository and enter the downloaded folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lorabasics/basicstation.git
cd basicstation
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:
Run the following commands in the basicstaion directory.
:::

4. Install all the dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
make platform=corecell variant=std
```

5. Replace the file `loragw_stts751.c` file using following command:


```bash
sudo cp -f /opt/ttn-gateway/sx1302_hal/libloragw/src/loragw_stts751.c deps/lgw1302/platform-corecell/libloragw/src/loragw_stts751.c
```

6. Make a clean build in the basicstation directory, and then do a `make` to install all dependencies with the changes.

```bash
make clean
make platform=corecell variant=std
```

7. As the installation is complete, you need to configure the Basics Station protocol. Enter the folder with the given examples by Semtech and specifically corecell folder as the build is for SX1302.

```bash
cd examples/corecell
```

8. First, change the reset pin in the `reset_gw.sh` to 17 in order to successfully start the concentrator.

```sh
#!/bin/sh

# This script is intended to be used on SX1302 CoreCell platform, it performs the following actions:
#        - export/unexport GPI023 and GPI018 used to reset the SX1302 chip and to enable the LDOs
#
# Usage examples:
#       ./reset_lgw.sh stop
#       ./reset_lgw.sh start
#
# GPIO mapping has to be adopted with HW
#

SX1302_RESET_PIN=17
SX1302_POWER_EN_PIN=18

WAIT_GPIO() {
    sleep 0.1
}
```

9. Create a new folder to store all the configuration files for basics station to connect to AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN.

```bash
mkdir lns-aws
```

10. Copy `station.conf` into this folder.

```bash
cp lns-ttn/station.conf lns-aws/
```

11.  Add the certificates that you downloaded earlier to **lns-aws**. (Refer to [Add the LoRaWAN Gateway](#add-the-lorawan-gateway).)

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7248/supported-lora-network-servers/aws/3.gateway-certificate.png"

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7248/supported-lora-network-servers/aws/4.provisioning-credentials.png"
  width="80%"
  caption="Provisioning Credentials"
/>

12. All the configurations about basics stations are ready. You should now have the files as follows:

```bash
pi@rak-gateway:~/basicstation/examples/corecell/lns-aws $ ls -al
total 28
drwxr-xr-x 2 pi pi 4096 Oct 28 17:57 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 pi pi 4096 Oct 28 17:44 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 pi pi 1225 Oct 28 17:57 cups.crt
-rw-r--r-- 1 pi pi 1680 Oct 28 17:57 cups.key
-rw-r--r-- 1 pi pi 1607 Oct 28 17:57 cups.trust
-rw-r--r-- 1 pi pi   69 Oct 28 17:57 cups.uri
-rw-r--r-- 1 pi pi 2460 Oct 28 17:46 station.conf
```

13. Before you start using basics station, disable the packet forwarder.
Use the command `sudo systemctl edit ttn-gateway.service` to edit the service of packet forwarder, and add the following codes to the file.


:::tip üìù NOTE:
If you want to re-activate the packet forwarder, you can just set the value of **Restart** to **always**.
:::

```bash
[Unit]
Description=The Things Network Gateway

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/opt/ttn-gateway/packet_forwarder/lora_pkt_fwd/
ExecStart=/opt/ttn-gateway/packet_forwarder/lora_pkt_fwd/start.sh
SyslogIdentifier=ttn-gateway
Restart=no
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

14. To apply changes made to the unit, execute the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

15. Restart the ttn-gateway service to load the new service configuration. Unit file must be restated if you modify the running unit file.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ttn-gateway.service
```

16. Find the ttn-gateway process PID and `kill` this process:

```bash
pi@rak-gateway:~/basicstation/example/corecell/lns-aws $ px aux | grep ttn-gateway
pi      28165   0.2     0.1     7680        2780    pts/0   S+  18:20   0:00 /bin/bash/opt/ttn-gateway/packet_forwarder/lora_pkt_fwd/start.sh
pi      28236   0.0     0.0     7348         488    pts/1   S+  18:20   0:00 grep --color=auto ttn-gateway
pi@rak-gateway:~/basicstation/example/corecell/lns-aws $ sudo kill 28165
```

17. Now, you can start basics station. Exit the configuration folder and start basics station.

```bash    
cd ..
./start-station.sh ‚Äìl ./lns-aws
```

  caption="Checking the device in the LoRaWAN Server"
/>

6. Use the following AT command to send an uplink message:

```
at+send:lora:1:1234567890
``` 

Here is the console log after sending uplink message:

```
1
OK
SYSLOG:4:LoRa Tx : 1234567890
EVENT:3:LORA_TX_DONE:1:OK
```


### Verifying Operation

Once setup is completed, provisioned OTAA devices can join the network and start to send messages. Messages from devices can then be received by AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN and forwarded to the IoT Rules Engine. 

Instructions for a sample Hello World application are given below, assuming that the device has joined and is capable of sending uplink traffic.

        if data_decoded[DATA_TYPES] == TYPE_TEMP:
            temp = data_decoded[DATA_TYPES + 1] << 8 \
                | data_decoded[DATA_TYPES + 2]
            temp = ctypes.c_int16(temp).value
            result['temperature'] = temp / 10

        return result


    def lambda_handler(event, context):
        data = decode(event)
        logger.info('Data: %s' % json.dumps(data))
        response = client.publish(topic=event.get('WirelessMetadata'
                                ).get('LoRaWAN').get('DevEui')
                                + '/project/sensor/decoded', qos=0,
                                payload=json.dumps(data))

#### Download the AWS IoT Greengrass Core Software

1. Greengrass has already been included in the SD card image, its directory is **~/greengrass-nucleus**.

You can also download the latest Greengrass core software and install it with commands as follows:

```bash
 $ rm ~/greengrass-nucleus -rf  
 $ wget  https://d2s8p88vqu9w66.cloudfront.net/releases/greengrass-nucleus-latest.zip  
 $ unzip greengrass-nucleus-latest.zip -d  ~/greengrass-nucleus  
 $ rm greengrass-nucleus-latest.zip 
```

2. Verify the version of the AWS IoT Greengrass Core software:

```bash
 $ java -jar  ~/greengrass-nucleus/lib/Greengrass.jar --version    
```

3. You will see the Greengrass version displayed - similar to: **AWS Greengrass v2.4.0**.

##### Provide Your Credentials

Run the following commands to provide the credentials to the AWS IoT Greengrass Core software.

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<the access key id for your account>
```

```bash
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<the secret access key for your account>
```

##### Run the Installer

1. Run the installer as shown below. Modify the values as per your region, install directory, and thing name. 
2. Use the **--provision true** option to have the installer set up the "thing" and required policies for you. If you prefer to configure Greengrass manually, see the [online guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/manual-installation.html).

```bash
sudo -E java -Droot="/greengrass/v2" -Dlog.store=FILE \

-jar ./GGCoreInstall/lib/Greengrass.jar \

--aws-region us-west-2 \

--thing-name thing-name \

--tes-role-name GreengrassV2TokenExchangeRole \

--tes-role-alias-name GreengrassCoreTokenExchangeRoleAlias \

--component-default-user ggc_user:ggc_group \

--provision true \

--setup-system-service true \

--deploy-dev-tools true
```

3. If all goes well, you will see the following output on the device console:

```
Successfully configured Nucleus with provisioned resource details!

Configured Nucleus to deploy aws.greengrass.Cli component

Successfully set up Nucleus as a system service
```

4. The local development tools (specified by the --deploy-dev-tools option) take some time to deploy. The following command can be used to check the status of this deployment:

```bash
aws greengrassv2 list-effective-deployments --core-device-thing-name thing-name
```

5. When the status is SUCCEEDED, run the following command to verify that the Greengrass CLI is installed and runs on your device. Replace /greengrass/v2 with the path to the base folder on your device as needed.

```bash 
/greengrass/v2/bin/greengrass-cli help
```
