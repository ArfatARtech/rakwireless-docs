## Product Configuration

### Accessing Your Gateway

After burning the firmware image onto the SD card, make sure you have inserted the SD card into the **RAK7243 WisGate Developer D3 Gateway** and have the LoRa and GPS Antenna connected. To learn more on how to burn the image, check the [Learn section](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/WisGate-Developer-Gateway-Firmware-Burning/).

After which, you can now safely power on the gateway. In this section, several ways to access the gateway are provided to have different alternatives for you to choose from depending on the availability of the requirements needed.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏èWARNING
Before powering the Raspberry Pi 3B+, you should connect the LoRa and GPS antennas. Not doing so might damage the boards.

:::

#### Wi-Fi AP Mode

By default, the gateway will work in Wi-Fi AP Mode which means that you can find an SSID named **Rakwireless_XXXX** on your PC Wi-Fi network list.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7243/quickstart/4.accessing your gateway/wifi.png" 
  width="80%"
  caption="RAKwireless access point"
/>

::: tip üìù NOTE:
`XXXX` is the last 2 bytes of your RAK7243 WiFi MAC address. Connect to this Wi-Fi SSID using the password provided below. Take note also of the default IP address of the gateway provided below as this will be needed in connecting via SSH.

- **Wi-Fi Password:** rakwireless
- **Default IP Address:** `192.168.230.1`
:::

#### Raspberry Pi 3B+ Ethernet Port

You can also connect your PC with the gateway through an Ethernet cable. By default, the IP address of the gateway‚Äôs Ethernet interface is `192.168.10.10`, so you need to set the IP address of your PC‚Äôs Ethernet to the same network segment, for example, `192.168.10.20`.

- To do this on a Windows PC, go to **Control Panel -> Network and Internet -> Network and Sharing Center** and click on **Ethernet**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7243/quickstart/4.accessing your gateway/network&sharing.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="Network and sharing center"
/>

- Click **Properties** then Choose **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7243/quickstart/4.accessing your gateway/ethernetproperties.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="Ethernet properties"
/>

- By default, the PC will obtain an IP address automatically. Click **Option Use the following IP Address** and enter the IP address `192.168.0.10.20`, then press **OK**. 

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7243/quickstart/4.accessing your gateway/tcpipv4.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="TCP/IPv4 properties"
/>

Now, you should be able to access your gateway from your PC successfully using the IP address `192.168.10.10` through SSH.

#### Log in to the Gateway

##### Windows OS

SSH (Secure Shell) is typically used to log in to a remote machine and execute commands. There are a lot of free and good SSH Clients out there namely [**Putty**](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html), [**BitVise SSH Client**](https://www.bitvise.com/ssh-client-download), [**MobaXterm**](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) and many more. Feel free to choose one that fits your needs. But for this guide, you will be using Putty.

#### Connect through Wi-Fi

If you want to connect through Wi-Fi, it can easily be done with the wireless capabilities of the Raspberry Pi 3B+ by choosing **5 Configure WIFI**. By default, the RAK7243 Developer works in Wi-Fi AP Mode. 

For the gateway to connect to the router, it must work in Wi-Fi Client Mode.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7243/quickstart/5.accessing the internet/wifi-config.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="Wi-Fi options configuration"
/>

There are 5 options to choose from in the Wi-Fi configuration menu:

1. **Enable AP Mode/Disable Client Mode** - the gateway will work in Wi-Fi Access Point Mode after rebooting while the Wi-Fi Client Mode will be disabled (this is the default mode).
2. **Enable Client Mode/Disable AP Mode** - the gateway will work in Wi-Fi Client mode after rebooting, while Wi-Fi AP Mode will be disabled.
3. **Modify SSID and pwd for AP Mode** - used to modify the SSID and password of the Wi-Fi AP. Only works if the Wi-Fi AP Mode is enabled.
4. **Add New SSID for Client** - this is used if you want to connect to a new Wi-Fi network. Only works in Wi-Fi Client mode.
5. **Change Wi-Fi Country** - this is used to modify the Resident Country to match Wi-Fi standards.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏èWARNING
To enable Wi-Fi Client Mode, you have to disable AP Mode first.
:::

   Once Wi-Fi AP Mode has been disabled by choosing **2 Enable Client Mode/Disable AP Mode**, you can now connect to a new Wi-Fi network by choosing **4 Add New SSID for Client**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7243/quickstart/5.accessing the internet/wifi-ssid.png"

#### Connect through Ethernet

If you want to connect to the router through an Ethernet cable, do the following steps:

- In the main configuration menu, choose **6 Configure LAN**. This will let you set up a static IP address for the gateway‚Äôs Ethernet adapter.
- Type a static IP address according to the IP address of the router you want to connect. The gateway and the router must be in the same network segment, otherwise the connection will fail.
- By default, the IP address of the gateway's Ethernet is `192.168.10.10`

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7243/quickstart/5.accessing the internet/gateway-eth-ip.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="Default gateway Ethernet IP address"
/>

* Then configure the IP address of the Router. This is the LAN Interface IP address of the router.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7243/quickstart/5.accessing the internet/router-eth-ip.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="LAN interface IP address of the router"

- Press **OK**, and the success message will appear.

#### Reboot

Lastly, reboot the gateway using the command shown below and put it in the command line. 


```
sudo reboot
```

After reboot, the gateway will connect to the router successfully through Ethernet.


#### Optional Configurations

The configurations under this section are only optional and situational.

##### Reverting to Wi-Fi AP Mode

If you have entered either or both incorrect Wi-Fi SSID and password in the Wi-Fi Client Mode setup for the RAK7243 Developer to connect to the router, follow this set of steps for you to work again in Wi-Fi AP Mode and redo the setup.


* Remove the SD card from your RAK7243 WisGate Developer D3 Gateway and insert it into your PC. Your PC should be able to detect it.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7243/quickstart/5.accessing the internet/rak-ap-file.png"

  caption="Creating rak_ap file to your SD card"
/>

- Using your **Command Prompt** or **Terminal**, navigate to your SD card and type this command to generate the `rak_ap` file.

```
cd > rak_ap
```

* Check if the `rak_ap` file is created successfully. If so, re-insert the SD card into your RAK7243 Developer and it should work again in Wi-Fi AP Mode.


### Configure the Gateway

If you have successfully logged into your gateway using SSH, enter the following command in the command line:

```
sudo gateway-config
```

Then you will see a page like in **Figure 20**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7243/quickstart/6.configure the gateway/gateway_id.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="Configuration options for the gateway"
/>

1. **Set pi password** - used to set/change the password of the gateway.
2. **Setup RAK Gateway Channel Plan** - used to configure the frequency, on which the gateway will operate, and the LoRaWAN Server which the gateway will work with.
3. **Restart packet-forwarder** - used to restart the LoRa packet forwarder.
4. **Edit packet-forwarder config**- used to open the `global_conf.json` file, to edit LoRaWAN parameters manually.
5. **Configure WIFI** - used to configure the Wi-Fi settings in order to connect to a network.
6. **Configure LAN** - used to configure the Ethernet adapter settings.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
 A unique ID will be generated in for gateway. This is also called **Gateway EUI** and is essential for registering the gateway with any LoRa network server (TTN and ChirpStack).
:::

There is also another way to get your **Gateway ID**. Just enter the command below in the command line:

```
sudo gateway-version
```

After choosing the correct frequency, a success message will appear, as shown in **Figure 28**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7243/quickstart/6.configure the gateway/success_freq_change.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="Successfully changed the frequency"
/>

::: tip üìù NOTE:

When a channel plan is selected, the gateway is configured to connect to the nearest cluster to the region. If new clusters are presented, the channel plans will be updated. For now, the only available clusters are as follows:

- Europe: eu1.cloud.thethings.network 
- Australia: au1.cloud.thethings.network
- North America: nam1.cloud.thethings.network

:::

##### Server is Chirpstack

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7243/quickstart/6.configure the gateway/chirpstack.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="Chirpstack server"
