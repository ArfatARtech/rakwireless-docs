## Product Configuration

### Accessing Your Gateway

After burning the firmware image onto the SD Card, make sure you have inserted the SD card into the **RAK7246/RAK7246G WisGate Developer D0/D0+ Gateway** and have the LoRa and GPS Antenna connected. To learn more on how to burn the image, check the [Learn section](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/WisGate-Developer-Gateway-Firmware-Burning/).

After which, you can now safely power on the gateway. In this section, several ways to access the gateway are provided to have different alternatives for you to choose from depending on the availability of the requirements needed.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏èWARNING
Before powering the Raspberry Pi 4, you should connect the LoRa and GPS antennas. Not doing so might damage the boards.
:::


#### Wi-Fi AP Mode

By default, the gateway will work in Wi-Fi AP Mode, which means you can find an SSID named **Rakwireless_XXXX** on your PC Wi-Fi network list.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7246g/quickstart/accessing-gateway/wifi.png"
  width="80%"
  caption="RAKwireless access point"
/>

::: tip üìù NOTE:
`XXXX` is the last 2 bytes of your RAK7244 WiFi MAC address. Connect to this Wi-Fi SSID using the password provided below. Take note also of the default IP address of the gateway provided below as this will be needed in connecting via SSH.

- **Wi-Fi Password:** rakwireless
- **Default IP Address:** `192.168.230.1`
:::

#### Log in to the Gateway

##### Windows OS

SSH (Secure Shell) is typically used to log in to a remote machine and execute commands. There are a lot of free and good SSH Clients out there namely [**Putty**](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html), [**BitVise SSH Client**](https://www.bitvise.com/ssh-client-download), [**MobaXterm**](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) and many more. Feel free to choose one that fits your needs. But for this guide, you will be using Putty.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7246g/quickstart/accessing-gateway/puttywindows.png"
  width="60%"
  caption="Putty Software for SSH in Windows"
/>

- It will then prompt you to enter the username and password. The default username and password are provided below:
  - **Username**: pi
  - **Password**: raspberry

<rk-img

##### Linux OS

If the OS of your PC is Linux, you should do the same as the Mac OS, except for the root mode.


### Accessing the Internet

Assuming you have successfully logged into your gateway using SSH, enter the following command in the command line:

```
sudo gateway-config
```

You will now then see a page the same as **Figure 8**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7246g/quickstart/accessing-internet/config-options.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="Configuration options for the gateway"
/>

1. **Set pi password**- used to set/change the password of the gateway.
2. **Set RAK Gateway Channel Plan** - used to configure the frequency, on which the gateway will operate, and the LoRaWAN server which the gateway will work with.
3. **Restart packet-forwarder** - used to restart the LoRa packet forwarder.
4. **Edit packet-forwarder config** - used to open the `global_conf.json` file, to edit LoRaWAN parameters manually.
5. **Configure WIFI** - used to configure the Wi-Fi settings to connect to a network.
6. **Configure LAN** - used to configure the Ethernet adapter settings.


#### Connect through Wi-Fi

If you want to connect through Wi-Fi, it can easily be done with the wireless capabilities of the Raspberry Pi Zero W by choosing **5 Configure Wifi**. By default, the RAK7246/RAK7246G WisGate Developer D0/D0+ Gateway works in Wi-Fi AP Mode. 

For the gateway to connect to the router, it must work in Wi-Fi Client Mode.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7246g/quickstart/accessing-internet/wifi-config.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="Configuration options for Wi-Fi"
/>

There are 5 options to choose from in the Wi-Fi configuration menu:

1. **Enable AP Mode/Disable Client Mode** - the gateway will work in Wi-Fi Access Point Mode after rebooting while the Wi-Fi Client Mode will be disabled (this is the default mode).
2. **Enable Client Mode/Disable AP Mode** - the gateway will work in Wi-Fi Client mode after rebooting, while Wi-FI AP Mode will be disabled.
3. **Modify SSID and pwd for AP Mode** - used to modify the SSID and password of the Wi-Fi AP. Only works if the Wi-Fi AP Mode is enabled.
4. **Add New SSID for Client** - this is used if you want to connect to a new Wi-Fi Network. Only works in Wi-Fi Client mode.
5. **Change Wi-Fi Country** - this is used to modify the resident country to match Wi-Fi standards.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
To enable Wi-Fi Client Mode, you have to disable first the AP Mode.
:::

Once Wi-Fi AP Mode has been disabled by choosing **2 Enable Client Mode/Disable AP Mode**, you can now then connect to a new Wi-Fi Network by choosing **4 Add New SSID for Client**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7246g/quickstart/accessing-internet/wifi-ssid.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="Add a new SSID"
/>

- Start by selecting your country of residence.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7246g/quickstart/accessing-internet/region.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="Selecting country of residence"
/>

- Enter the SSID of the network you want to connect.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
Make sure to input the correct Wi-Fi SSID and password, or you will not be able to connect to the RAK7246/RAK7246G again via SSH in Wi-Fi AP Mode. If stuck in this situation, follow this procedure listed in the [Reverting Back to Wi-Fi AP Mode](/Product-Categories/WisGate/RAK7246G/Quickstart/#reverting-to-wi-fi-ap-mode) section, which is applicable for all Raspberry Pi based gateways to work again in Wi-Fi AP mode.
:::

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7246g/quickstart/accessing-internet/set-wifi.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="SSID of the network you want to connect"

#### Optional Configurations

The configurations under this section are only optional and situational.
##### Reverting Back to Wi-Fi AP Mode

If you have entered either or both incorrect Wi-Fi SSID and password in the Wi-Fi Client Mode setup for the RAK7244C WisGate Developer D4+ Gateway to connect to the router, follow these set of steps for you to work again in Wi-Fi AP Mode and redo the setup.

- Remove the SD card from your RAK7244C WisGate Developer D4+ Gateway and insert it into your PC. Your PC should be able to detect it same as **Figure 16**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7246g/quickstart/accessing-internet/rak-ap-file.png"
  width="50%"
  caption="Creating rak_ap file to your SD card"
/>

- Using your **Command Prompt** or **Terminal**, navigate to your SD Card and type this command to generate the `rak_ap` file.

```
cd > rak_ap
```

- Check if the `rak_ap` file is created successfully. If so, re-insert the SD card into your RAK7246/RAK7246G WisGate Developer D0/D0+ Gateway and it should work again in Wi-Fi AP Mode.



### Configuring the Gateway

- Assuming you have successfully logged into your gateway using SSH, enter the following command in the command line:
  
  ```
  sudo gateway-config
  ```

Then you will see a page like **Figure 17**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7246g/quickstart/configure-gateway/gateway_id.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="Gateway configuration options"
/>

1. **Set pi password** - used to set/change the password of the gateway.
2. **Setup RAK Gateway Channel Plan** - used to configure the frequency, on which the gateway will operate, and the LoRaWAN Server which the gateway will work with.
3. **Restart packet-forwarder** - used to restart the LoRa packet forwarder.
4. **Edit packet-forwarder config**- used to open the `global_conf.json` file, to edit LoRaWAN parameters manually.
5. **Configure WIFI** - used to configure the Wi-Fi settings in order to connect to a network.
6. **Configure LAN** - used to configure the Ethernet adapter settings.

::: tip üìù NOTE:
A unique ID will be generated for the gateway. This is also called **gateway EUI** and is essential for registering the gateway with any LoRa Network Server (TTN and ChirpStack).
:::

There is also another way to get your gateway ID, just enter the command below in the command line:

```
sudo gateway-version
```

  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7246g/quickstart/configure-gateway/gateway_id_cmd.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Gateway ID using the command line"
/>

#### Setting a New Password for the Gateway

It is a good security practice to change the default password **raspberry**, which is the same on all Raspberry Pi devices.

1. First, choose **1 Set pi password** option.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7246g/quickstart/configure-gateway/set_pi_pwd.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="Set Pi password"
/>

2. Next, press **Yes**. You will be asked to enter your new password twice then press **Enter**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7246g/quickstart/configure-gateway/confirm_pwd.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="Confirm password change"

3. A success message for changing the password will then pop up.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7246g/quickstart/configure-gateway/success_pwd_change.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="Successful Password Change"
/>

#### Setup RAK Gateway Channel Plan

This menu allows you to select your LoRa frequency band and one of the two available Networks Server options by choosing **2 Setup RAK Gateway Channel Plan**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7246g/quickstart/configure-gateway/setup_rak_gateway.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="Choosing channel plan"
/>

You can choose one of two supported LoRa servers here: **TTN** or **ChirpStack**.


##### Server is TTN

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7246g/quickstart/configure-gateway/server_ttn.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="TTN server"
/>

* **TTN (The Things Network)** - If you choose TTN as the LoRa Server, you will see a page the same as shown in **Figure 27**. Visit [LoRa Alliance Regional Parameters](https://lora-alliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/RP002-1.0.3-FINAL-1.pdf) for more information on your local frequency plan. This will allow you to choose the correct plan. 

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7246g/quickstart/configure-gateway/ttn_channel_plan.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="Selecting the TTN channel plan"
/>

After choosing the correct frequency, a success message will appear, as shown in **Figure 25**.


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7246g/quickstart/configure-gateway/success_freq_change.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="Successfully changed the frequency"
/>

::: tip üìù NOTE:

When a channel plan is selected, the gateway is configured to connect to the nearest cluster to the region. If new clusters are presented, the channel plans will be updated. For now, the only available clusters are as follows:

- Europe: eu1.cloud.thethings.network 
- Australia: au1.cloud.thethings.network
- North America: nam1.cloud.thethings.network

:::

If you want to use TTN for LoRa Network server, you can skip the **If the Server is ChirpStack** section and head to registering the gateway in [TTN](https://eu1.cloud.thethings.network/console/).

##### Server is Chirpstack

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7246g/quickstart/configure-gateway/chirpstack.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="Chirpstack server"
/>

**ChirpStack** - If you choose Chirpstack as your LoRa Server, you will see the following page with two options available:
- **ChirpStack Channel Plan Configuration** - used to configure your Regional Frequency Band.
- **ChirpStack ADR Configure** - used to enable/disable the Adaptive Data Rate (ADR)
  functionality.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7246g/quickstart/configure-gateway/chirpstack_channel.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="Configure ChirpStack channel plan"
/>

First, select **1 ChirpStack Channel-plan configuration** for configuring your frequency channel.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7246g/quickstart/configure-gateway/chirpstack-channel-plan.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="Regional frequency band option"
/>

Then set the IP address of the ChirpStack.


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7246g/quickstart/configure-gateway/loraserver_ip.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="Default LoRaServer IP address"
/>


:::tip üìù NOTE:
The default IP Address is `127.0.0.1`. If you want to use an external ChirpStack, you need to set it to its IP Address.
:::

* If you have instead selected **Chirpstack ADR Configure**, you can enable/disable the Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) functionality.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7246g/quickstart/configure-gateway/adr_settings.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="Chirpstack ADR Enable/Disable"
