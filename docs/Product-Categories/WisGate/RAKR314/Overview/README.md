## Product Description

The RAKR314 carrier board is designed specifically for the Raspberry Compute Module 4, following the Raspberry Pi 4 form factor. This feature-packed board includes a standard 40-pin GPIO and supports the RAK PoE HAT, making it an excellent choice for power-over-ethernet applications. With two USB 2.0 ports, two USB 3.0 ports, two USB-type C ports (one for power and one for programming), and an Ethernet port, this board has all the connectivity options you need. Additionally, the SD card slot provides extra storage for the eMMC CM4 modules or serves as the main (boot) for non-eMMC modules.

One of the best things about the RAKR314 is that it allows you to utilize the power of the CM4 module in the familiar Raspberry Pi form factor, so you can take advantage of all your existing HATs. And, with the included enclosure kit, building your devices has never been easier.
