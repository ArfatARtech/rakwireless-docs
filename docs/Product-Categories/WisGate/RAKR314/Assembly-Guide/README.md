5. The kit provides pre-drilled holes for antennas if you are using additional HATs like the RAK5146 HAT for LoRaWAN or the RAK2013 HAT for cellular connectivity. If they will be not used you can cover them with the provided rubber caps. Additionally, you can hide the unused ports on the side of the enclosure with the provided sticker.
