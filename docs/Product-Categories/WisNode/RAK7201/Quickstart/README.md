In this section, the main functionality of the different keys (buttons) of the device will be addressed. 

Default payload data of the keys:

| Key   | Data |
| ----- | ---- |
| Key 1 | A    |
| Key 2 | B    |
| Key 3 | C    |
| Key 4 | D    |

To customize the data sent by every button, the following AT command is used:

```
at+button=<button>:<port>:<data>
```

Where:
- **`<button>`** - The configured key (range 1-4)
- **`<port>`** - Configured port number (range 1-223)
- **`<data>`** - The sent data (max length is 10 characters) 

Example: 

Change the data sent from the pressing of button 1 to HelloWorld using the command:

```
at+button=1:1:HelloWorld
```

To check the data of the buttons you can execute the command:

```
at+get_config=device:status
```

The result is shown in Figure 23.

## HeartBeat function

The HeartBeat is used to monitor the network connection and to send the battery level information of the WisNode Button 4K. 

The device can send a HeartBeat packet according to the configured HeartBeat interval. The AT command for configuring the HeartBeat interval is:

```
at+heartbeat=<interval>
```

 Where the interval range is 0-120 (in hours), 0 to turn off the function.

Example:

Set the HeartBeat to one hour using the command:

```
at+heartbeat=1
```
