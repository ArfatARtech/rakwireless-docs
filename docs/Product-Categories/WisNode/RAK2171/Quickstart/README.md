## Product Configuration

WisNode TrackIt supports three working modes:
1. [LoRaWAN Mode](#lorawan-mode)
2. [P2P Mode](#lora-peer-to-peer-p2p-mode)
3. [Third-party LNS](#third-party-lorawan-network-server-lns-mode)

### LoRaWAN Mode

To fully utilize the WisNode TrackIt and the TrackIt App in this mode, you need to use RAK WisGate Edge gateway/s.

In this mode, the WisNode TrackIt is configured via the TrackIt application on your phone. The TrackIt application automatically registers the RAK2171 trackers in the WisGate Edge gateways' Built-in Network Server.

<rk-img

## TrackIt LoRaWAN Payload

TrackIt is the latest GPS LoRaWAN tracker by RAKwireless. The name hints what is the device‚Äôs purpose ‚Äì to track something, whether it is a person, an asset, an animal, or anything else. In addition to the tracking application, the device can be used to send SOS or a 6-level alarm signal, based on movement, vibration, fall, etc. The different payloads of the device are explained in this section.


### Header/Payload Type/Message ID

<table>
 <thead><tr><th colspan="2">1&nbsp;byte</th><th colspan="2">1&nbsp;byte</th></tr></thead>
 <tbody>
     <tr><td>HEADER</td><td>Payload time</td><td>Reserved</td><td>Message ID</td></tr>
     <tr><td>2&nbsp;bit</td><td>6&nbsp;bit</td><td>3&nbsp;bit</td><td>5&nbsp;bit</td></tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

- **Header** - by default, the Header is 11.
- **Payload type** ‚Äì different payload types are explained in this table above.
- **Message ID** ‚Äì an internal counter for the message. The first 5&nbsp;bits are for the message ID. The other 3 are reserved.

### Header/Payload Type

The different payload types that TrackIt can send are explained below. If the GPS has a fix, it will send data of the location. If a 6-level alarm is activated in the application, the device will send a message when the working pattern is activated.

With 5 clicks on the power button, the device will start sending SOS messages. When the SOS is canceled, a message will also be sent.
