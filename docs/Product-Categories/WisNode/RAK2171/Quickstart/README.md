## Product Configuration

WisNode TrackIt supports three working modes:
1. [LoRaWAN Mode](#lorawan-mode)
2. [P2P Mode](#lora-peer-to-peer-p2p-mode), 
3. [Third-party LNS](#third-party-lorawan-network-server-lns-mode).

### LoRaWAN Mode

To fully utilize the WisNode TrackIt and the TrackIt App in this mode, you need to use RAK WisGate Edge gateway/s.

In this mode, the WisNode TrackIt is configured via the TrackIt application on your phone. The TrackIt application automatically registers the RAK2171 trackers in the WisGate Edge gateways' Built-in Network Server.
